# Widget

What every control is, before it is anything in particular.

`Widget` is the class at the root of the set: a `Label`, a `Button`, a `Split`, a
`Form` and a component of your own all have everything on this page, with the
same names and the same meanings. **You never make one** — there is no
`new Widget()` — and that is the point: what is here is the vocabulary that does
not change from one control to the next, so learning it once is learning it for
all of them.

Two classes sit between this and the rest, and they add nothing a form has to
learn separately: **`Control`** is the branch for the things that are not
containers, and **[`Container`](Container.md)** is the one for the things that
hold other controls — `Add`, `Children`, `Clear` and the layout words live there.

## Every member

Everything it has, in one place. Each links to where it is explained; the short
phrase is there so a name can be found by eye, and the sentence that matters is
in the section.

**Properties**

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| `AcceptDrop` | receives a drop from **this application**, which arrives as `Drop(data, x, y)` | [drag and drop](#drag-and-drop) |
| `AcceptFiles` | receives files dragged in from **the desktop**, which arrive as `FileDrop(paths, x, y)` | [drag and drop](#drag-and-drop) |
| `Action` | the **command** this control points at, or `""` | [commands, menus and keys](#commands-menus-and-keys) |

| `Border` | width, style and colour in one string | [how it looks](#how-it-looks) |

**Methods**

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| `Bounds([container])` | `{ X, Y, Width, Height }`: what GTK really allocated, in window coordinates or in the coordinates of the container you pass | [where it is and how big](#where-it-is-and-how-big) |
| `CssNode()` | the GTK node name it is styled as (`"button"`, `"entry"`) | [what it answers about itself](#what-it-answers-about-itself) |
| `Delete()` | removes it **and destroys it** | [shown, enabled, focused](#shown-enabled-focused) |
| `Emit(event, ...args)` | raises an event that arrives by name on the host form | [commands, menus and keys](#commands-menus-and-keys) |
| `EventNames()` | the events it raises, **most derived first** | [what it answers about itself](#what-it-answers-about-itself) |
| `Hide()` | makes it invisible | [shown, enabled, focused](#shown-enabled-focused) |
| `Lower()` | and to the bottom | [how it is placed](#how-it-is-placed) |
| `Move(x, y)` | `X` and `Y` together, because that reads better in a loop | [where it is and how big](#where-it-is-and-how-big) |
| `On(event, fn)` | installs **this control's own** handler for an event, for a control built in code: no name, and nothing left on the form to delete | [commands, menus and keys](#commands-menus-and-keys) |
| `OriginIn(container)` | `[x, y]`: where this widget's corner is in that container's space | [where it is and how big](#where-it-is-and-how-big) |
| `PopupMenu(x, y)` | opens that menu at a point in this control's own coordinates — how a button that drops a menu is built | [commands, menus and keys](#commands-menus-and-keys) |
| `PropertyOptions(name)` | the exact strings that property accepts, or an empty list | [what it answers about itself](#what-it-answers-about-itself) |
| `Raise()` | to the top of the painting order, among its siblings on a surface | [how it is placed](#how-it-is-placed) |
| `Remove()` | detaches it from its parent **without destroying it**, so it can be put somewhere else | [shown, enabled, focused](#shown-enabled-focused) |
| `Resize(width, height)` | sets `Width` and `Height` together | [where it is and how big](#where-it-is-and-how-big) |
| `SetFocus()` | gives it the keyboard focus | [shown, enabled, focused](#shown-enabled-focused) |
| `Show()` | makes it visible | [shown, enabled, focused](#shown-enabled-focused) |
| `SizeRequest()` | `[width, height]` as requested, with `-1` on an axis nobody declared | [where it is and how big](#where-it-is-and-how-big) |
| `StyleRule()` | the CSS rule this widget's own class currently carries | [what it answers about itself](#what-it-answers-about-itself) |
| `TextProperties()` | which of this control's properties hold prose, which is what the catalogue collects and what a designer offers to translate | [words on it](#words-on-it) |

**Events**

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| `Allocated(box)` | the first real rectangle, once | [where it is and how big](#where-it-is-and-how-big) |
| `DblClick(x, y, button, ctrl, shift)` | two clicks | [the mouse and the keyboard](#the-mouse-and-the-keyboard) |
| `DragBegin()` | this control started travelling | [drag and drop](#drag-and-drop) |
| `DragEnd()` | the drag finished, however it did | [drag and drop](#drag-and-drop) |
| `DragEnter(data, x, y)` | a drag came over it | [drag and drop](#drag-and-drop) |
| `DragLeave()` | the drag went **without dropping** | [drag and drop](#drag-and-drop) |
| `DragOver(data, x, y)` | a drag moved over it. **`false` refuses it** | [drag and drop](#drag-and-drop) |
| `Drop(data, x, y)` | something was dropped on it | [drag and drop](#drag-and-drop) |
| `FileDrop(paths, x, y)` | files were dropped on it | [drag and drop](#drag-and-drop) |
| `GotFocus()` | the focus arrived **anywhere within it** | [shown, enabled, focused](#shown-enabled-focused) |
| `KeyPress(key, ctrl, shift, alt)` | a key went down. **`true` consumes it** | [the mouse and the keyboard](#the-mouse-and-the-keyboard) |
| `KeyRelease(key, ctrl, shift, alt)` | and came up | [the mouse and the keyboard](#the-mouse-and-the-keyboard) |
| `LostFocus()` | *the user is done with this one* | [shown, enabled, focused](#shown-enabled-focused) |
| `MouseDown(x, y, button, ctrl, shift)` | a button went down on it | [the mouse and the keyboard](#the-mouse-and-the-keyboard) |
| `MouseEnter(x, y)` | the pointer came in | [the mouse and the keyboard](#the-mouse-and-the-keyboard) |
| `MouseLeave()` | and left | [the mouse and the keyboard](#the-mouse-and-the-keyboard) |
| `MouseMove(x, y, button, ctrl, shift)` | it moved over it; `button` is `0` | [the mouse and the keyboard](#the-mouse-and-the-keyboard) |
| `MouseUp(x, y, button, ctrl, shift)` | and came up | [the mouse and the keyboard](#the-mouse-and-the-keyboard) |
| `MouseWheel(dx, dy)` | the wheel turned. **`true` consumes it** | [the mouse and the keyboard](#the-mouse-and-the-keyboard) |

**And what `rad.js` adds**, on every widget just the same — `PropertyNames()`,
`Serialize()`, `Apply(properties)`, `Declared(name)`, `Fill(…)`, `Dump()`,
`SetDesign(name, value)`, `DesignValue(name)`, `SetItem(of, count)`, `Item` — in
[what it answers about itself](#what-it-answers-about-itself).

## Name and identity

| | |
|---|---|
| `Name` | how the form reaches it — `this.BtnSave` — and the prefix its handlers carry: `BtnSave_Click`. A valid JavaScript identifier, unique on the form |

**The name is the wiring.** Events are dispatched by name: a control called
`BtnSave` raises its `Click` at the method `BtnSave_Click` on the form that owns
it, and nothing has to be connected, registered or bound. Renaming a control
renames its handlers — which is why the IDE's rename does both, and why renaming
one by hand in a `.form` leaves a handler nothing will ever call.

It is also why a widget built in code gets a `Name` before it gets anything else
if you want events from it, and why two controls on one form may not share one.

## Where it is and how big

| | |
|---|---|
| `X` | the left edge, in the parent's coordinates. **It means something only inside a container laying out by coordinate**; in a row or a column the parent decides and this reports where it ended up. `-32767`..`32767`, like `Y` and `Move` |
| `Y` | the top edge, likewise |
| `Width` | width **requested**: a minimum, not an exact size. Reads the allocation when nothing was declared. `0`..`32767` (or `-1`, *not asked*) — a display holds no more, and more was a `BadAlloc` that killed the process; the same for `Height`, `MinWidth`, `MinHeight` and `Resize`. Reading it gives what was asked for, falling back to what GTK allocated when nothing was |
| `Height` | the height, likewise |
| `MinWidth` | the floor a stretched control may not be squeezed below. Only means something on an axis whose `HAlign` is `Fill` |
| `MinHeight` | the same for `VAlign` |
| `Move(x, y)` | `X` and `Y` together, because that reads better in a loop |
| `Resize(width, height)` | sets `Width` and `Height` together |
| `SizeRequest()` | `[width, height]` as requested, with `-1` on an axis nobody declared. What the serialiser asks, so that a measurement never becomes a floor |
| `Bounds([container])` | `{ X, Y, Width, Height }`: what GTK really allocated, in window coordinates or in the coordinates of the container you pass |
| `OriginIn(container)` | `[x, y]`: where this widget's corner is in that container's space |

**A declared size is a floor, not a promise.** `Width: 80` on a `Label` with a
long sentence in it is a label wider than 80, and that is GTK doing what it was
asked. To keep something inside a width, the control needs a way to give text up
— `Ellipsize`, `Wrap`, a `Scroller` around it.

**Nothing has a size before a frame** — and `Form_Open` runs before the window is
even presented, so a measurement taken there measures nothing. **`Allocated` is
the moment to wait for**: raised once, when GTK has really given the control a
rectangle, carrying the same box `Bounds()` answers. A control on a hidden page
hears it when the page is shown, because that is when it gets one.

```js
/* The room exists now: fit the picture to it. */
this.Pic.On("Allocated", (box) => this.fitTo(box));
```

**An already-allocated control never hears it.** The moment has gone, and
`Timer.After(0, …)` is not a way to get it back — it is *one* frame and not *the*
frame, and how many a window needs before it is mapped and laid out is the
machine's business, which is why the five places that used to do this each
carried their own retry count. For a control that may have one already, ask
first:

```js
const box = this.Pic.Bounds();
if (box.Width > 0) this.fitTo(box);
else               this.Pic.On("Allocated", (b) => this.fitTo(b));
```

## How it is placed

| | |
|---|---|
| `Expand` | absorbs the slack on both axes — the one word that makes a control fill the room left over in a row or a column |
| `HExpand` | the horizontal half of it, when the two answers differ |
| `VExpand` | absorbs vertical slack |
| `HAlign` | `Auto` `Start` `End` `Center` `Fill` — what becomes of it when the container is not the size the coordinates were drawn for |
| `VAlign` | the same, vertically |
| `Margin` | room **around** it: one number for all four sides, never a list. On a `Form` it insets the contents, a window having no outside. Not a list. |
| `ColumnSpan` | how many columns of a `Grid` it runs under. `1` |
| `TabIndex` | where Tab reaches it on a surface laid out by coordinate. Sparse, never renumbered; `0` means *in drawn order*. The IDE edits it as a list — *Form > Tab order...* — which is the shape a relation needs |
| `Raise()` | to the top of the painting order, among its siblings on a surface |
| `Lower()` | and to the bottom |

**A stretched control asks for its floor and not for the size it was drawn at**,
and this is the rule that surprises people once: on an axis whose alignment is
`Fill`, the size request becomes `MinWidth`/`MinHeight` rather than
`Width`/`Height` — because the number in the `.form` is where the gaps were
measured from, not a minimum the window must always leave room for. Without it, a
window could never be made smaller than the form was designed. It is also how a
component with a drawn size of its own is put into a small pane: `HAlign` and
`VAlign` of `Fill`, and the floor is whatever `MinWidth`/`MinHeight` say.

## Shown, enabled, focused

| | |
|---|---|
| `Visible` | shown or not. `true` by default; a `Form` starts `false` and `Show()` is what presents it |
| `Show()` | makes it visible |
| `Hide()` | makes it invisible. A hidden control **keeps its place in the tree** and its position in a box |
| `Enabled` | answers the mouse and the keyboard. `true` by default, and **read-only in effect while `Action` is set**: a control that points at a command takes the command's answer |
| `Focusable` | can take the keyboard focus. Turn it on for a container that wants keys — a drawing surface, a board. The answer is the **control's** and not the outside widget's: a `TextBox` reads `true` while the entry GTK lays out is not focusable at all, its inner `GtkText` being where the focus really sits |
| `Focused` (ro) | whether the focus is **within** it, which is why a `TextBox` answers `true` while the focus really sits on the entry inside it. **On a `Form` it is also whether the window is the one the user is in**: it turns `false` when another window is activated and `true` again when this one is -- measured under a window manager -- which is what a program asks before deciding a notification is worth sending |
| `SetFocus()` | gives it the keyboard focus |
| `Remove()` | detaches it from its parent **without destroying it**, so it can be put somewhere else |
| `Delete()` | removes it **and destroys it**. What is in it goes too |
| **event** `GotFocus()` | answers for the **control**, so it fires for the focus arriving anywhere within it |
| **event** `LostFocus()` | where *the user is done with this box* is said — validation, formatting, saving a field |

**`Remove()` and `Delete()` are the pair worth keeping straight**: one hands the
control back to you, the other ends it. Re-parenting in GTK4 needs the first,
because a container refuses a widget that already has a parent.

## How it looks

| | |
|---|---|
| `Style` | the CSS classes it wears, space separated: `"card title-3"`. **The first thing to reach for**: the theme draws `suggested-action`, `destructive-action`, `dim-label`, `title-1`…`title-4`, `heading`, `card`, `frame`, `boxed-list`, `toolbar`, `flat`, `linked`, `pill`, `monospace`. A name that could not be a class is refused |
| `Background` | any CSS colour — a value, not a reference: `"@view_bg_color"` is one too, and is refused. **For a ground, `Style` is what to reach for**: a theme paints a surface with a class, and a control that has to be on the same ground as another one wears the same class. `""` restores the theme's. The **exception** to `Style`, for when the colour is data — a status, a category, a swatch |
| `Foreground` | likewise, for the text |
| `Font` | a Pango description — `"Cantarell Bold 12"` — or a partial one: `"Bold"`, `"12"`. `""` restores the theme |
| `FontScale` | a multiplier on whatever size is in force: `1.1` is 110%. `1` is "nothing said"; `0` is refused |
| `Opacity` | `0`…`1`, where `1` is *nothing said* |
| `Padding` | room **inside** it, one to four sizes. `"0"` asks for none, `""` takes the theme's |
| `Radius` | rounded corners, one to four sizes in CSS order: `"8"`, `"8 8 0 0"`. `""` or all zeroes is square |
| `Border` | width, style and colour in one string: `"2 dashed #3584e4"` |
| `Shadow` | `"x y blur [spread] [colour]"`. One shadow, never inset. A colour alone or a bare number is refused |
| `Cursor` | what the pointer looks like over it: `Auto` (nothing said) `Arrow` `Hand` `Grab` `Grabbing` `Text` `VerticalText` `Wait` `Progress` `Help` `Crosshair` `Cell` `ContextMenu` `Move` `Scroll` `Copy` `Link` `NoDrop` `NotAllowed` `ZoomIn` `ZoomOut` `None` `ResizeHorizontal` `ResizeVertical` `ResizeTopLeft` `ResizeTopRight` `ResizeColumn` `ResizeRow`. Reaches the parts a control is made of, so it is seen over an entry's text too — but a *child* control with one of its own wins, which is why `Form.Cursor = "Wait"` is not a busy pointer for the whole window |
| `Dark` (ro) | whether it is drawn on a dark ground, derived from the ink its text uses. The same answer `Painter.Dark` gives, and a `Form` raises `ThemeChange` when the desktop moves it. What a drawing chooses its palette by |

**Reach for `Style` before the colour properties.** A class is a name the theme
paints, and it follows the desktop into dark mode, into a high-contrast theme and
into whatever the next release does; a hard-coded `Background` is a decision made
once, on one theme. The colour properties are for the case where the colour *is*
the information.

**Nothing here is a stylesheet.** What a `Style` class means is the theme's, or
your project's `app.css` — see [styles](../../resources.md) — and what this
property does is say which classes the control wears.

## Words on it

| | |
|---|---|
| `Tooltip` | plain text, and `""` is none rather than an empty balloon. **Translated** |
| `TextProperties()` | which of this control's properties hold prose, which is what the catalogue collects and what a designer offers to translate |
| `Fill(…args)` | fills the **declared** text as a template: a `Label` declared `"{0} files"` and filled with `12` reads *12 files*, and the number stays out of the catalogue |
| `Declared(name)` | what the `.form` said, whatever has been assigned since — which is what makes `Fill` possible on a control that has already been filled once |

Prose belongs in the `.form` and reaches the user through the catalogue; values
are filled in from code. `Fill` is the join between the two, and the reason a
translated string can carry `{0}` at all.

## Commands, menus and keys

| | |
|---|---|
| `Action` | the **command** this control points at, or `""`. A control that has one takes its `Enabled` — and its `Text` and `Icon`, when it declared neither — from the command, and **refuses** to be told an `Enabled` of its own. Only a control that is pressed can have one; a name that is not one of the form's `actions` is refused. See [forms.md](../../llm/forms.md#actions-one-command-in-several-places) |
| `Shortcut` | the key that activates it: `"F5"`, `"<Control>s"`, or a list `["7", "KP_7"]`. **`Return` never fires**, the window claiming it for its default button |
| `Menu` | a context menu, as the same array of items a form's `menus` uses. Reassigning replaces it. The items name handlers on the form, so a control built in code is **added before** its `Menu` is assigned — before that it is refused with a sentence. **An item's name belongs to one menu**: a second menu declaring it, or a name already taken by a control or a member of the form, is refused — one command in several menus is a form `action` with an `{ "action": … }` item in each. Rebuilding the same menu is fine |
| `PopupMenu(x, y)` | opens that menu at a point in this control's own coordinates — how a button that drops a menu is built |
| `Emit(event, ...args)` | raises an event that arrives by name on the host form. **What a component announces itself with** |
| `On(event, fn)` | installs **this control's own** handler for an event, for a control built in code: no name, and nothing left on the form to delete. Installing again replaces; `On(event, null)` removes; it answers with the control, so it chains. The handler is called with `this` undefined; an event name that is not in `EventNames()` throws, and so does installing one the form already answers by name — a control has one handler for one event, refused at `On`, at a rename, and at the `Add` that brings the control to that form. It is also how a `Component` added from code is heard: its `Emit` finds this before the `<name>_<event>` road |

**A control a designer drew, and a control built in code.** A designer names a
control and the handler is `<Name>_<Event>` on the form — which is the whole of
how a `.form` is wired, and needs nothing else. A control built in code has no
name anybody chose, and giving it one purely to build that property out of
leaves a **global on the form** that outlives the control: build the same
palette twice and the old handlers are still there. `On` is that case, and only
that case.

A control never has both: **the pair is refused at whichever act completes it**,
and there are three. `On` throws when the form already answers that event by
name; assigning a `Name` throws when the control already carries a handler the
new name would answer; and **`Add` throws** when a control arrives at a form
carrying both — which is the one the other two cannot cover, since they ask
about the control's form and a control built in code has none until it is added.
Two handlers for one event is an ambiguity, and eight of this runtime's events
are asked a question rather than told something, so only one of two answers
could ever be used. `On(event, null)` is always allowed — taking a handler away
cannot make a pair — and the check is not total, since a `<Name>_<Event>`
assigned onto the form afterwards is not something the runtime can watch.

`On` is also how a **component added from code** is heard. Such a component
keeps itself as its event target — only the `.form` loader rebinds one to its
host — so `<Name>_<Event>` on the host never fires for it. Its `Emit` reads the
control's own handler first, so `card.On("Changed", …)` answers, with nothing
rebound.

```js
const b = new Button();
b.Icon = name;
b.On("Click", () => this.choose(name));
panel.Add(b);
```

The handler is called with `this` **undefined**, like every other callback this
runtime is handed — a closure captures what it needs. An event name that is not
in `EventNames()` throws where it is written, rather than never firing.

**One command, several places.** A toolbar button, a menu item and a context menu
entry that all do the same thing should all name the same `Action`: its
availability is computed once and every one of them follows. Three copies of
`Enabled = …` is how a menu item comes to be greyed while its button is not.

## Drag and drop

| | |
|---|---|
| `DragData` | the string that travels when this control is dragged. Empty turns dragging off |
| `AcceptDrop` | receives a drop from **this application**, which arrives as `Drop(data, x, y)` |
| `AcceptFiles` | receives files dragged in from **the desktop**, which arrive as `FileDrop(paths, x, y)`. Independent of `AcceptDrop`: a control may take one, the other, or both |
| **event** `Drop(data, x, y)` | something with `DragData` was dropped on a widget with `AcceptDrop`. The point is in **this widget's** coordinates, and so is `Bounds(this widget)` asked of a child — so *which row a drop is over* is a comparison and not arithmetic, and on a scroller both numbers already carry the scroll (a child above the view reads a negative `Y`). A hidden child measures 0x0, so skip what is not `Visible`. Only arrives when the drop was not refused (see `DragOver`). **Undo here whatever `DragEnter` lit up**: no `DragLeave` follows a drop (see its row). Refused drops never arrive (see `DragOver`). |
| **event** `FileDrop(paths, x, y)` | files were dropped from the file manager or the desktop on a widget with `AcceptFiles`. `paths` is an array of full paths — **only files that have one**: a file on a remote share has no local path and does not arrive, and a drop of nothing but those is refused rather than delivered empty |
| **event** `DragEnter(data, x, y)` | the drag came over a widget with `AcceptDrop`, carrying the same point `Drop` will. What the target lights up with — a column, a highlight — goes here. **The refusal does not live here**: a `false` from this one is overwritten by the very next `DragOver`, which in any real drag is immediately, so a target that refuses says so in `DragOver` |
| **event** `DragOver(data, x, y)` | the drag moved over it, point after point. Where an insertion line sits is recomputed here. **Returning `false` refuses the drop at that point**: the cursor shows it and `Drop` never fires. Anything else — including answering nothing — accepts it, and with no handler everything is accepted. Strictly `false`: a handler that answers nothing returns `undefined`, which must not refuse every drag anywhere |
| **event** `DragLeave()` | the drag left without dropping. Undoes what `DragEnter` did — **and a drop is not a leave**: measured, nothing arrives after a `Drop`, and the leave for that target is delivered at the *next* drag instead, right after its `DragBegin` and for a target that drag never touched. So a target undoes its own feedback in `Drop` as well, and anything counting enters against leaves has to expect the late one |
| **event** `DragBegin()` | on the widget being dragged: the drag started. Grey the card here |
| **event** `DragEnd()` | on the widget being dragged: the drag finished — dropped or refused. Puts back whatever `DragBegin` changed |

`data` in `DragEnter`/`DragOver` is the dragged string, preloaded on hover: without preload the value would only exist at drop. Still loading on a very early `enter` answers `""` rather than holding the event back. There is no feedback half for `FileDrop`: files from the desktop have no travelling string to preload.

**A drop is not a leave, so the target undoes its own feedback in `Drop`.**
Measured with a real pointer: after a `Drop` nothing else arrives — five
seconds of stillness and no `DragLeave` — and the leave for that target is
delivered at the **next** drag instead, right after its `DragBegin` and for a
target the new drag never went over. So a column that lights up in `DragEnter`
stays lit after a card lands on it unless `Drop` puts it out, and anything
counting enters against leaves has to expect the late one. A drag that leaves
without dropping, and a drop that was refused, both do raise it in the gesture
they belong to.

**The point is in the accepting control's own coordinates, and so is
`Bounds(that control)`** — which is what lets a drop be *placed* rather than
appended: the row it is over is the first child whose middle is below it, one
comparison and no arithmetic. **A scroller's numbers already carry its scroll,
both of them.** Measured on a column scrolled down: the drop arrived at
`y = 168`, the cards above the view read `Y: -293, -206, -119, -32` and the ones
in it `55, 142, 229`, so adding `ScrollY` would count the scroll twice.
A control that is hidden measures **0x0 at the origin** rather than keeping its
old rectangle, so anything comparing against children has to skip what is not
`Visible`. [`examples/kanban`](https://github.com/getbintana/bintana/tree/main/examples/kanban) places a dropped card
from exactly that comparison.

## The mouse and the keyboard

Every widget raises these, with coordinates **relative to itself**:

| | |
|---|---|
| **event** `MouseDown(x, y, button, ctrl, shift)` | coordinates are relative to the widget |
| **event** `MouseUp(x, y, button, ctrl, shift)` | and came up |
| **event** `MouseMove(x, y, button, ctrl, shift)` | the pointer moved over it. `button` is `0` here |
| **event** `MouseEnter(x, y)` | the question motion cannot answer: there is no `MouseMove` for having left |
| **event** `MouseLeave()` | and left — the question motion cannot answer, since there is no `MouseMove` for having gone |
| **event** `MouseWheel(dx, dy)` | how far the wheel turned, in GTK's units: one notch is `1.0` on a wheel and a fraction on a touchpad. **Returning `true` consumes it**, which stops the scroller around it from also moving |
| **event** `DblClick(x, y, button, ctrl, shift)` | two clicks |
| **event** `KeyPress(key, ctrl, shift, alt)` | a key went down. **Returning `true` consumes it.** A control that edits text claims a printable key, so on a `TextBox` `b` arrives only as `KeyRelease` |
| **event** `KeyRelease(key, ctrl, shift, alt)` | and came up. Nothing here is consumable |

`key` is the desktop's name for the key — `"Left"`, `"Page_Down"`, `"Escape"`,
`"space"`, `"F5"`, `"plus"` — not a character.

**These are additive and arrive after the control's own behaviour**: a `Button`
still clicks, and a `MouseDown` handler on it runs as well as, not instead of.

## What it answers about itself

Written in `rad.js` rather than in C, and on every widget just the same. This is
the half that makes a designer, a serialiser and a test possible without any of
them being privileged:

| | |
|---|---|
| `PropertyNames()` | every settable property, found along the prototype chain — including the ones a component of your own declares |
| `PropertyOptions(name)` | the exact strings that property accepts, or an empty list. What fills a drop-down in the property grid, and the reason a list of values is never typed twice |
| `EventNames()` | the events it raises, **most derived first**: `[0]` is the one a double click in the designer writes a handler for |
| `Serialize()` | this widget as a `.form` node |
| `Apply(properties)` | the widget: the inverse of `Serialize`. A missing dictionary applies nothing, so `Apply(maybe)` is safe |
| `Dump()` | prints the whole subtree with the geometry GTK really allocated. **Reach for this instead of a screenshot**, in a test and while working |
| `StyleRule()` | the CSS rule this widget's own class currently carries |
| `CssNode()` | the GTK node name it is styled as (`"button"`, `"entry"`) |
| `SetDesign(name, value)`, `DesignValue(name)` | what the **designer** shows instead of what the code will fill in. Unreachable from a running application |
| `SetItem(of, count)`, `Item` (ro) | a container: the component the **designer** draws in it while the form is laid out, and how many. See [`item`](../../formats.md#item-what-a-list-holds-while-it-is-being-designed) |

### Asking the class instead

Every one of those has a class-level twin, for a caller holding the **name** and
no control — a palette, a property grid, an extractor:

```js
Widget.PropertyNames("Button")         // what a control can be set to
Widget.Methods("Button")               // what it can be asked to do
Widget.EventNames("Button")            // what it raises, most derived first
Widget.TextProperties("Button")        // which properties hold prose
Widget.PropertyOptions("Label", "Alignment")
Widget.Member("Button", "SetFocus")    // "Method"; "" for one it has not got
Widget.Signature("Button", "Bounds")          // "([container])"
Widget.EventSignature("Button", "MouseDown")  // "(x, y, button, ctrl, shift)"
```

The answer is the one a control gives, because it is the same walk started at the
class prototype — a class and a control cannot disagree. A name that is no class
throws the way `Widget.New` does, and an **abstract** class answers
(`Widget.PropertyNames("Widget")`), which is the question no control could be
made to answer. `Widget.Member` adds the kind to the `in` a control answers:
`ReadOnly` is the one a `.form` refuses to load over. A **method's parameters**
and an **event's** are two questions — `ListBox.Select` is both — and the class
declares each beside itself.

## What goes wrong

- **The handler never runs.** The method's prefix is not the control's `Name`, or
  the control was built in code and never given one. `EventNames()` says what it
  raises; the name says where it arrives.
- **It came out bigger than the `.form` says.** A size is a floor. Give the text
  a way to give up — `Ellipsize`, `Wrap` — or put the thing in a `Scroller`.
- **It came out smaller, or the window will not shrink.** The opposite half of
  the same rule: on a `Fill` axis the floor is `MinWidth`/`MinHeight`, and a
  control that must never be squeezed below something says so there.
- **`Bounds()` answered zeroes.** Nothing has been laid out yet. Measure from
  `Timer.After(0, …)`, not from `Form_Open`.
- **`Enabled = false` did nothing.** The control has an `Action`, and the command
  decides. Set it on the command.
- **The colours look wrong in dark mode.** Hard-coded `Background`/`Foreground`
  do not follow the theme. Use `Style`, and ask `Dark` when a drawing has to
  choose ink for itself.
- **A key never arrives.** Something ahead of it consumed the press, or the
  control is not `Focusable`, or `Return` — which the window's default button
  claims — was the key.
- **A control moved to another parent threw.** GTK4 refuses a widget that already
  has a parent: `Remove()` it first, which detaches without destroying.

## What it does not do

- **No `Text`.** Not every widget has words; the ones that do declare their own,
  and `Caption` is the alias `Form`, `Label`, `Button`, `TextBox` and
  `CheckButton` answer to.
- **No stylesheet of its own.** `Style` names classes; what they mean is the
  theme's or `app.css`'s.
- **No animation, no transition, no transform.** A control is where it is.
- **No `Parent`.** A widget does not publish the container it is in: what holds
  what is the form's, and asking upwards is how a control comes to know about the
  screen it is on.
