# Charts — the library that ships with the runtime

`Chart` is not a control. It is a **component** written in Bintana, in the
`charts` library that comes with the runtime, and it is reached the way any
library is: name it in `project.json`, then use its class in a `.form`.

```json
{ "name": "Sales", "startup": "MainForm", "uses": ["charts"] }
```

```json
{
  "type": "Chart", "name": "Sales",
  "properties": { "Type": "Bar", "Title": "By quarter",
                  "Labels": ["Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"], "Legend": "Bottom" }
}
```

```js
this.Sales.Series = [{ Name: "2026", Values: rows.map((r) => r.Total) }];
```

That division is the whole idea: **what the chart is** goes in the `.form`, where
the designer edits it and the catalogue translates it; **the numbers** come from
code. `uses` finds the library with nothing installed and nothing configured —
where it is looked for is in [the project file's
reference](../formats.md#libraries-uses), and a name that is not found stops the
program printing every path it tried.

The example is `examples/charts`: five shapes, two axes, stacking, curves, and
21,600 readings you can zoom into.

## Chart

One class, and `Type` says which kind. Every property redraws when it is
assigned, and every one of them is designable and serialised, so a form may
declare any of them.

| Member | |
|---|---|
| `Type` | `Bar` `Line` `Area` `Pie` `Doughnut`. Defaults to `"Bar"`. |
| `Series` | the data: `[{ Name, Values, Color, Colors, Axis }]` — see below. Defaults to `[]`. Assigning it redraws |
| `Labels` | the category axis, as strings. As many as there are values is a label per bar; **fewer** is marks spread evenly across the plot; a pie names its slices from them. Defaults to `[]`. |
| `Marks` | `[{ At, Text }]`, `At` being an index into the values — a **real** time axis, where the caller says where each label goes. Replaces `Labels` on the x axis while it is set. Defaults to `[]`. |
| `Legend` | `None` `Top` `Bottom`. It wraps to at most **three** rows and whatever did not fit is not drawn: a legend of thirty series is the wrong control, and eating the plot to hold one is worse. Defaults to `"Bottom"`. |
| `Grid` | the horizontal rules behind the data. Defaults to `true`. |
| `Stacked` | series piled instead of side by side. Applies to `Bar` and `Area`; a line and a pie **ignore** it rather than refusing, so the order of two lines in a `.form` never matters. Defaults to `false`. |
| `ShowValues` | the number on the bar or the percentage in the slice, drawn only where it measures as fitting. Defaults to `false`. |
| `Title` | above the plot. **Translated**. Defaults to `""`. |
| `YMin` | pins the bottom of the y axis; `""` (or `null`) works it out from the data, on *nice* numbers rather than on the data's own extremes. A value that is not a finite number is refused where it is assigned — stored, it left the axis with no ticks and every frame threw. Defaults to `""`. |
| `YMax` | likewise the top. Defaults to `""`. |
| `Decimals` | how the numbers are written, `0` to `6`; goes through `Locale.Number`, so the separators are the user's. Defaults to `0`. |
| `Antialias` | smooth edges. Off is faster and looks it; `Reduced` is the knob that actually matters. Defaults to `true`. |
| `Curved` | rounded lines for `Line` and `Area`, **monotone**: between two samples the curve stays between their values and flattens at a peak instead of inventing a taller one. Off by default because a curve says something about values nobody measured. Defaults to `false`. |
| `Reduced` | more points than pixel columns are decimated to a min and a max per column, which keeps the envelope — a one-sample spike survives it. Defaults to `true`. On by default |
| `From` | the first value on screen. Defaults to `0`. |
| `Count` | how many are on screen; `0` is all of them. Defaults to `0`. |
| `Zoomable` | lets the wheel zoom and a drag pan — see [what the pointer does](../reference/libraries/Chart.md#what-the-pointer-does). Off by default, so a chart of four bars never steals a scroll from the `Scroller` around it. Defaults to `false`. |
| `Refresh()` | redraws now. **Assigning any property already does**, so this is for the case where the numbers changed **in place** |
| `Save(path, width, height)` | the same drawing to a PNG of any size — a chart in a report, or in a bug report |
| `Document` (ro) | the chart itself — a `ChartDocument`, which is what draws. Every property below that is not about the pointer is a property of it |
| **event** `Select(series, at, value)` | a click on a bar, a point or a slice. `at` is the index into that series' `Values` |
| **event** `Hover(series, at, value)` | the pointer passing over one, **which is not a selection**: a chart that reported a click as a hover could not have a tooltip. On a line or an area it is the first series; on a **stacked** `Area` it is the band the pointer is inside (the top one above them all), `value` is that series' own value, and the mark is drawn at the top of its band |
| **event** `Range(from, count)` | the window changed — the wheel, a drag, or the double click that resets it |

### `Series`

```js
chart.Series = [
    { Name: "2026", Values: [15, 12, 21, 18] },
    { Name: "Margin %", Values: [31, 28, 35, 33], Color: "#e5a50a", Axis: "Right" },
];
```

| | |
|---|---|
| the series' `Name` | what the legend and a hover call it; `Series 1`, `Series 2`… when omitted |
| `Values` | the numbers. A number or numeric text is a value; **anything else — `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `""`, a word — is a gap**: a line or an area stops there and starts again at the next value, a bar is not drawn, and the pointer over it reports nothing. A gap is never a zero |
| `Color` | any CSS colour; omitted, it takes the next of the library's eight, chosen to hold up on a light theme and a dark one |
| `Colors` | **a colour per value**, for the charts where a value is a shape of its own: each slice of a `Pie` or a `Doughnut` and its legend entry, and each bar of a `Bar`. A list; an entry that is missing or `""` is the colour the chart would have chosen. What the colour means — a severity, a status — is the caller's: `Colors: ["#e45959", "#ffa059", "#97aab3"]`. A string is refused, since one colour for the whole series is `Color` |
| `Axis` | `"Left"` or `"Right"`. `"Right"` gives that series **its own** range, ticks and margin — two series in different units on one scale is the classic chart that lies |

Assigning `Series` replaces the lot; it is a value, not a handle, so mutating the
array you passed changes nothing until you assign again or call `Refresh()`.

A **pie or doughnut reads the first series only** and names its slices from
`Labels`: a pie of two series is two pies, so it draws one. Only positive values
are slices, and **each keeps its own index** — a zero between two slices leaves
its label, its colour and its `Select`/`Hover` index where they were, and the
legend still names it.

## ChartDocument

**The chart with no control.** Everything a chart *is* — the type, the data, the
axes and the drawing of them — lives in a `ChartDocument`, and the `Chart` above
holds one as `Document` and adds what a screen has: the pointer, the wheel, a
drag and the three events. Every property in the table above that is not about
the pointer is the document's, under the same name and with the same default, so
a `.form` that declares `Type` on a `Chart` goes on doing so.

It exists because a control needs a display, and a `main` project — a report run
from a timer, a tool over ssh — never has one. A document needs nothing: it draws
through [`Drawing`](library.md#drawing), so a console program has charts too.

```json
{ "name": "nightly", "main": "Main", "uses": ["charts"] }
```

```js
function Main() {
    const c = new ChartDocument();
    c.Type   = "Line";
    c.Title  = "Load";
    c.Labels = hours;
    c.Series = [{ Name: "web-1", Values: load }];
    c.Save("/var/reports/load.png", 800, 400);
}
```

|---|---|
| `Paint(p, width, height)` | draws the chart with `p` into `width`×`height` — for a painter something else opened: a `Drawing`, a report's page, a `DrawPage` of your own. The ink is the painter's `Foreground`, so on paper it is black |
| `Save(path, width, height)` | the drawing to a PNG of any size. **No widget and no display**: it draws through `Drawing`, so a `main` project has charts too |
| `ToPng(width, height)` | the same drawing as `Save`, answered as `Bytes` — a chart to attach or put in a reply, with nothing on disk |

**On paper the ink is black.** A document drawn through `Drawing` has a painter
with no control behind it, and such a painter's `Foreground` is black — so the
title, the axes and the legend come out readable on a white page whatever the
desktop's theme. A `Chart`'s own `Save` runs its canvas instead, and takes the
theme's ink; on a dark desktop that is light text on a transparent ground, which
is the one to avoid for a page. `Paint` draws with whatever painter it is handed,
which is how a chart goes onto a page of a `Drawing.SavePdf` beside other things,
or into a `Draw` or `DrawPage` of your own. A `Task` cannot draw one: a worker
installs no painter and no `Drawing`.

## What the pointer does

Nothing until `Zoomable`, and then: the wheel zooms about the pointer, a drag
pans, and a double click goes back to all of it. Each of the three raises
`Range`, and the wheel notch is only consumed when the view actually changed —
zooming out a view that already shows everything answers `false` and raises no
`Range` — so a chart inside a `Scroller` still scrolls it at the ends.

`Select` and `Hover` are raised whether or not the chart is zoomable, and both
carry the index into the *whole* series — never the position on screen.

## The one performance fact

The cost of a frame is in **pixels covered**, not in points, and in an
interpreter the passes over the data cost more than the drawing. Both show up in
the same measurement, on 21,600 readings in an 800-wide plot:

```
decimated      59.0 frames/s    3.5 ms in the handler
every point    13.2 frames/s   46.6 ms
```

`Reduced` is on by default and is why the first line exists. The rest is the
caller's: the first working version of this component drew at 35 frames a second
because it computed the y range with `flatMap` over all 21,600 values **on every
frame**, and neither the values nor the range had changed. If you hand a chart a
long series, do the arithmetic once and keep it.

## What it does not do

No animation, no radar, no candlesticks, no second x axis, no logarithmic scale,
and no tooltip window — `Hover` is there so the form can put the text where it
wants it.

**Three things of Chart.js' are left out on purpose**, since that is the library
this one was measured against: its *plugin system*, because a component's subclass
is the extension point here; its *animation by default*, because `Timer.Every` and
`Refresh()` are enough for the rare case and a chart that animates on every change
of data is one nobody can read a number off; and its *config object*, because a bag
of nested options is the opposite of a designable control — which is the whole
argument of this environment, and the reason `Type`, `Legend` and `Labels` are
properties in a file. `Chart` is a component like any other: it is
[`lib/charts/Chart.js`](https://github.com/getbintana/bintana/blob/main/lib/charts/Chart.js), about a thousand lines of
ordinary Bintana, and a project that needs a shape it has not got can extend it
or copy it into its own `lib/`.
