# The library

Every name here is a global: ambient, always present, no import.

## Application

| | |
|---|---|
| `Name` | from `project.json` |
| `Id` | from `project.json`: the application's identity in reverse DNS — `io.github.you.App`. It is **one name in three places**: the window's own class (the runtime hands it to `GtkApplication` for Wayland and to the program name for X11's `WM_CLASS`), the `<id>` of the project's metainfo, and the Flatpak app id. `""` when the project declares none, which is an ordinary project classed by the program's name; a value that is not an application id **stops the program when the project loads**, because every one of those three is something nobody looks at until a dock shows the wrong icon |
| `Version` | what the **project** calls its release; `""` when it declares none. **`BTA_VERSION` is the runtime's** and is not this — showing the wrong one is what an About box does until it knows the difference |
| `Directory` | the project directory, absolute. What a relative path in a project resolves against — an image a report draws, a document a viewer opens, a data file that ships with the application |
| `ConfigDirectory` | `~/.config/bintana/<name>`, **created at startup**, which is where anything the application remembers belongs. [`Settings`](../reference/globals/Settings.md) writes there; nothing of yours should go in the project directory, which is a thing people hand to each other |
| `Executable` | the `bintana` binary that is running this, so a project can re-invoke it — which is how the IDE runs a project and how the test runner runs the suites |
| `Arguments` | whatever followed the project directory on the command line, as an array |
| `HasIcon(name)` | whether that icon will actually **draw** something. Not whether the theme claims it: an icon that cannot be rasterised here is the same nothing as one that is missing |
| `HasCommand(name)` | whether that program is on the PATH. **The question that does not need an exception**, since [`Exec`](../reference/globals/Exec.md) throws when the program is not there |
| `Icons([contains])` | every icon name available, sorted, narrowed by substring — what an icon picker is built from |
| `DecorationLayout` | how this desktop arranges a title bar — which buttons, and on which side. What a drawn title bar reads to look like the real one |
| `CheckSource(text)` | `null` when the text is valid JavaScript, else `{ Message, Line, Column }`. What an editor checks a file with before saving it, and the answer `new Function(src)` is not allowed to give |
| `Symbols(text)` | what the text declares — `[{ Name, Kind, Line, Parent, Super, Params, End, Doc, Returns }]`, out of the parser and with nothing run. **`Kind` is `"Class"`, `"Function"`, `"Method"`, `"Static"`, `"Getter"`, `"Setter"`, `"StaticGetter"` or `"StaticSetter"`**, or **`"Assigned"`** (a function assigned at the top level, named by its target as written — `File.LoadJson`, `Widget.prototype.Dump` — and each function an object literal holds when the literal is assigned there, as `Target.Name`), or **`"Variable"`** (each `let`/`const`/`var`, destructured name, `for...of` variable and `catch` binding, at its line) and **`"Scope"`** (every function, anonymous ones included, with its `Params` and the lines it spans, `Line` to **`End`**; one that fails to parse spans up to where it broke) — together, what a name can mean where the cursor is — the member kinds are what separates `Value: T` from `Value(): T`, and a property of the class from one of the instance. **`Params` is the parameter list in the spelling a declaration uses** — `(message, [options], ...rest)`, `()` for a member that takes none, `""` for a class — for members and top-level functions, and **it is the function's own**: an arrow in its body or in a default value does not replace it. It is the one answer a host cannot get elsewhere, because ECMAScript discards a parameter's name at parse time and `Function.length` is a lower bound the moment one has a default. **`Super` is the name in a class's `extends`** and `""` for everything else, including an `extends` that is not a bare identifier. **`Doc` is the JSDoc comment touching the declaration** — the text before its first `@tag` — and **`Returns` the type in its `@returns {T}`**, both `""` when there is none; a comment that does not end on the line above or the same line documents nothing. What an editor lists a file with, and the answer a pattern is not allowed to guess at |
| `LibraryPath(name, [project])` | where a library by that name is, or `""` — **the same six-place search the runtime does for `uses`**. Published so that a tool which opens *other* projects asks about theirs rather than keeping a second copy of the path |
| `Globals()` | every name on the global object: the runtime's own, the ones a library installed, and the JavaScript builtins -- `Math`, `JSON`, `Date`, `Map`, `Timer`, `Confirm`. **A top-level `class` is a lexical binding and not a property of the global object**, so a library's and a project's classes are *not* in it -- read those out of the sources, which is what the IDE does. It exists because the alternative is a hand-written list of global names, and there are a hundred and sixty-four of them |
| `Libraries([project])` | the names of every library those same six places offer, sorted, each one once. The other direction of the lookup: `LibraryPath` resolves a name you already know, this is what a dialog that offers a choice needs |
| `Replacements()` | every name this language takes away, and what to write instead. It is a bag keyed by the name that went: `{ setTimeout: "Timer.After(delay, tick) — the delay comes first", "Object.assign": "{ ...a, ...b }", … }`. **`""` where there is no word for that thing here**, which is an answer rather than a gap in the table. An editor asks it of an identifier nobody can find, so a beginner meets `Timer` at the token rather than a `ReferenceError` at the next run |
| `OnError` | assign `(message, stack) => …` to take over uncaught errors |
| `Quit(code)` | quit with that exit status. `0` is *it worked*, and a console tool that answers a question answers with this. A `code` that is not a number is **refused** — `Quit("fail")` used to exit `0`, which a runner reads as success. A `code` that is not a number is refused rather than read as `0`, which a runner would take for success; `Quit()` is `0` |

`BTA_VERSION` is the **runtime's** version, and is not
`Application.Version`. Showing the wrong one is what an About box does until it
knows the difference.

`HasCommand` is the question that does not need an exception: `Exec` throws when
the program is not there.

## Environment

The context the program was started in.

`Get(name)` (or `null`), `Set(name, value)` (`null` removes; it is `export`, so
it affects everything started afterwards), `Variables`, `CurrentDirectory`
(assigning enters, and **throws** if there is no such directory), `HasDisplay`,
`ProcessId`, `ProcessorCount`, `HomeDirectory`, `TempDirectory`, `UserName`,
`HostName`, `OS`, `OSVersion`.

`HasDisplay` asks the environment — `DISPLAY` or `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` — and not
this process, which is what a program about to start something else needs to
know. On Windows there is no such variable and a session always has one, so it
answers `true` there.

The command line is `Application.Arguments` and quitting is `Application.Quit`:
those belong to the application, not to the system.

## Desktop

The session this program is running in: where a user's own things go, by the
freedesktop conventions every Linux desktop follows. `DataDirectory`,
`ConfigDirectory`, `CacheDirectory` and `Entries`.

| | |
|---|---|
| `DataDirectory` | `$XDG_DATA_HOME`, or `~/.local/share` when the desktop has not moved it. Application data that belongs to this user: a database, a saved document, an installed menu entry |
| `ConfigDirectory` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, or `~/.config`. Settings, kept apart from data because a backup or a sync usually wants one and not the other |
| `CacheDirectory` | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`, or `~/.cache`. Anything that can be thrown away and rebuilt |
| `Entries` | the module below |

`ConfigDirectory` is the root and **not** `Application.ConfigDirectory`, which is
this project's own directory inside it.

## Desktop.Entries

The `.desktop` files a **user** installs for themselves, in
`DataDirectory/applications`. That directory is where a menu entry put there by a
program appears in the desktop's menu — with no root, no package and nothing to
restart. The format is the freedesktop *Desktop Entry Specification*, read and
written through GLib's own key-file implementation, so the escaping and the
localized keys (`Name[es]`) are the platform's and not a second interpretation
of them.

| | |
|---|---|
| `Directory` | `DataDirectory/applications`, created on first use. Write an entry there and the desktop's menu offers it; there is nothing to register and no index to update |
| `Exec(argv)` | the value for the `Exec` key: the arguments as an array — the shape `Exec` and `Terminal.Run` already take — quoted and escaped the format's way |
| `Installed()` | the ids in `Directory`, sorted, `.desktop` removed. Only this user's: a system entry is never listed, and asking whether an entry is installed is one `includes` on this |
| `Read(id)` | one entry as data, exactly what `Install` takes, or `null` when there is no such file |
| `Install(id, entry)` | writes `Directory/<id>.desktop` and answers the path. Atomic — a temporary beside it, renamed over — so a failure leaves whatever was there |
| `Write(path, entry)` | the same entry and the same checks at a path the caller names, **making the directory** when it is not there. For the entry a package installs, which is not one this user's menu has; answers nothing |
| `Uninstall(id)` | removes it, answering whether there was one. A file that is there and cannot be removed throws |

An id is the file's name without `.desktop` — letters, digits, `-`, `_` and `.`
— and an entry is the file as data, group by group:

```js
const exec = Desktop.Entries.Exec([Application.Executable, Application.Directory]);

Desktop.Entries.Install("hello", {
    "Desktop Entry": {
        Type:    "Application",
        Name:    "Hello",
        Comment: "A greeting",
        Exec:    exec,
        Icon:    "applications-development",
    },
});
```

`Read` answers the same shape, so an entry is read, changed and written back.

**An entry that is not one is refused instead of written.** The `[Desktop Entry]`
group is required, with a `Type` and a `Name`; a `Type=Application` without an
`Exec` is refused too. Every desktop skips a file that breaks those rules, and it
skips it in silence — which is the one failure this cannot leave a caller to
find by looking at a menu that has nothing in it. Values must be text.

**The `Exec` string is not the shell's.** It is the desktop entry format's own
quoting, and it sits on top of the key file's escaping — an argument with a
space, a `"`, a `$`, a `` ` ``, a `\` or a `%` in it is exactly the case that
cannot be written by hand. `Desktop.Entries.Exec(argv)` is the whole of the
answer, and what a program should use.

## Message

`Message.Info(text, ...args)`, `Message.Warning(…)`, `Message.Error(…)`.

**They show and return.** They do not block and there is no answer. The first
argument is a text position, so it takes `{0}` holes and goes through the
catalogue — never a template literal there. With no display they print to
stderr.

```js
Message.Error("Cannot open {0}: {1}", path, e.message);
```

A question that needs an answer is a form: [forms.md](forms.md#a-dialog-that-asks-something).

## Notification

A desktop notification: for when the window is **not what the user is looking
at** — a long job that ended while they were somewhere else. [`Message`](#message)
is the other way to say something, and it is modal, so it takes the window.

```js
Notification.Send(Locale.Text("Backup finished"), Locale.Text("{0} files", n))
const id = Notification.Send("Disk almost full", "3% left",
                             { Urgency: "Urgent", Icon: "drive-harddisk-symbolic" })
Notification.Withdraw(id)
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Send(title, [body], [options])` | shows a desktop notification and answers its id. With no body, the second argument may be the options: `{ Id, Urgency, Icon }`. `Urgency` is `"Low"`, `"Normal"` (the default), `"High"` or `"Urgent"`; `Icon` is a theme icon name; sending again with the same `Id` **replaces** what is showing. The title and body are not looked up in a catalogue -- wrap them in `Locale.Text`. Refused in a project with a `main`, which has no application to send from |
| `Withdraw(id)` | takes a notification back, by the id `Send` answered or was given. An id nothing is showing under is not an error |

**The project has to declare an `id`** in `project.json`: a notification is sent in
the name of an application, and without one GLib fails an assertion and sends
nothing — so this refuses, saying what to declare. **A project with a `main` has no
application at all** and refuses too; a tool says it is done on stdout.

The options are `Id` (sending again with the same one **replaces** what is
showing), `Urgency` — `"Low"`, `"Normal"` (the default), `"High"`, `"Urgent"` — and
`Icon`, a theme icon name. With no body the second argument may be the options. An
option that is not one of these is refused, so `{ Urgancy: "High" }` is an error
and not a quiet normal one. **On a freedesktop desktop `High` and `Normal` look the
same**: the daemon knows low, normal and critical, and only `"Urgent"` is critical.

**The title and body are not looked up in a catalogue here.** Wrap them in
`Locale.Text` at the call site, which is where the extractor looks and where `{0}`
interpolates. **There is no click that calls back**, no buttons, sound or image: a
callback held by a notification the desktop owns outlives the window that sent it,
and nothing needs one yet. [`examples/backup`](https://github.com/getbintana/bintana/tree/main/examples/backup) sends one when its window is
not the one the user is in.

## Locale

| | |
|---|---|
| `Text(msgid, ...args)` | the catalogue's version of a string, with `{0}`, `{1}` filled in from the arguments. **The msgid itself when there is no entry**, so an application with no catalogue at all still reads correctly |
| `Plural(one, many, n, ...args)` | the form `n` takes **by the catalogue's own rule** — which is not *one or many* in every language, and is why this is not an `if` you write yourself. `n` also fills `{0}` |
| `Context(ctxt, msgid, ...args)` | gettext's `msgctxt`, for the word that is not translated the same way twice — *Open* the verb on a button and *Open* the state of a file. The context is part of the key and is never shown |
| `Current` | which catalogue is in use, `""` for none. **Assigning reloads it, and affects only what is built afterwards** — a form already on screen keeps the words it was built with |
| `Available` | the catalogue names this project ships, sorted — what a language menu is built from |
| `Read(path)` | a catalogue as data, losing nothing: entries, contexts, plurals, comments and the fuzzy flags. What a translation editor reads |
| `Write(path, entries)` | those entries back as a `.po` — the same shape `Read` answers with, so the two are one pair. **Nothing is lost in either direction**, which is what makes an editor built on them safe on a file it only half understands. The two are one pair: what the reader kept, the writer writes |
| `Number(value, [decimals \| options])` | grouped, with this desktop's separators. As many decimals as the value has, unless told |
| `Currency(value, [decimals \| options])` | money, with the symbol where this desktop puts it — which is before the number in some places and after it in others |
| `Parse(text, [options])` | a [`Decimal`](../reference/globals/Decimal.md), or `null` when the text is not a number. **`null` and not a throw**: a field being typed into is not an error. The same format read backwards |
| `Date(when, [format])` | `"Date"` `"Time"` `"DateTime"` `"ISO"` `"Weekday"` `"Month"`. `when` is a `Date` **or** a `"YYYY-MM-DD"` string |
| `Compare(a, b)` | `-1`, `0` or `1`, in the order this desktop puts names in. `localeCompare` is **refused** and its message points here: it compares code units and puts `Álvarez` after `Zapata` |
| `Matches(text, needle)` | whether a search for `needle` should find `text`, **accents folded**: `cordoba` finds `Córdoba` and `ver` finds `Echeverría`. `toLowerCase().includes()` does neither |
| `DecimalPoint` | the character a decimal is written with here, for the rare case that has to parse one back |

```js
Locale.Number(1234567.891)        // 1.234.567,891
Locale.Number(1234567.891, 2)     // 1.234.567,89
Locale.Number(km, { Decimals: 1, Suffix: " km" })   // 12,5 km
Locale.Currency(v, { Symbol: "US$" })               // US$ 1.234,56
Locale.Parse("1.234,56")          // → 1234.56
Locale.Parse("12,5 kg", { Suffix: " kg" })
Locale.Date(new Date())           // 31/08/26
Locale.Date(when, "DateTime")     // lun 31 ago 2026 14:05:09
Locale.Compare("Ñanculeo", "Ortiz")
Locale.Matches("Echeverría", "ver")   // true
```

**In a `Task`, `Locale` is the facts and not the catalogue**: `Number`, `Date`,
`Currency`, `Parse`, `Compare`, `Matches` and `DecimalPoint` are there, because
they read the process locale that every thread inherits, while `Text`, `Plural`,
`Context`, `Current`, `Available` and `Read`/`Write` are not, because they read
a table the main thread fills and reloads. Ordering ten thousand names is the
work a worker is started for; translating one is not.

**The options object is the same one a `DecimalBox` keeps as its format** —
`{ Decimals, Group, Prefix, Suffix, Symbol, Before, Space, Currency }` — so a
label, a report and a field spell an amount the same way, and `Locale.Parse` is
the same format read backwards. `Symbol` is another currency's symbol and the
side it goes on stays this desktop's (`US$ 1.234,56` here, `$1,234.56` there).
A `Decimal` goes through its own digits in both directions, and `Parse` answers
`null` rather than throwing: text that is not a number yet is an ordinary state
in a field somebody is typing into.

**`Locale.Date` takes a calendar date as it stands**, so nothing a
[`Day`](#day) or a `Field.Date` holds ever needs converting:

```js
Locale.Date("2026-12-25")             // 25/12/26
Locale.Date("2026-12-25", "Weekday")  // viernes
Locale.Date("2026-12-25", "Month")    // diciembre
```

Reaching for `new Date(y, m, d, 12)` to get a month or a weekday out of one is the
mistake this saves you — the noon is there to dodge the time zone that borrowing an
instant introduced, and the string never had one.

**Use `Locale.Compare`; `localeCompare` is refused**, because here it compares
code units and puts `Álvarez` after `Zapata`. **A bare `list.sort()` and a plain
`a < b` give that same wrong order and do not refuse** — they never claimed to
know about language, and they are the right thing for paths, extensions and the
keys of a bag. Over text a person reads, write `list.sort(Locale.Compare)`.
`Locale.Matches` is its half for a search field. `Locale.Number` and
`Locale.Currency` take a `Decimal` and write it from its own digits, never
through a double.

Most text needs none of this: see
[forms.md](forms.md#text-a-person-reads).

## File

A **path is a string** and `Save`'s text is a string: anything else is refused
with a sentence. It used to convert, so `Save(undefined, t)` wrote `./undefined`,
`Delete(undefined)` deleted it, and a record without its `Serialize()` replaced
the file with `[object Object]`. The same holds for every verb here and in
[`Directory`](#directory) that touches the disk, and for `Database.Sqlite`,
`DrawingArea.Save`/`SavePdf` and `Printer.ToFile` — `Directory.Make(undefined)`
made a folder called `undefined`. The one exception is the question:
`Exists`/`IsDir` of something that is not a string answer `false`.

| | |
|---|---|
| `Load(path)` | the whole file as a string. **Throws if it cannot be read**, and the message names the file: there is no `null` to test for and no silent empty string |
| `Save(path, text)` | writes it **atomically** — a temporary beside it, renamed over — so a failed write leaves the old file intact and a reader never sees half a file |
| `Append(path, text)` | adds `text` to the end, and creates the file when it is not there. A log or a CSV written line by line wants this: `Save(path, Load(path) + line)` is the whole file through memory for every line, and a window in which another writer's line is overwritten |
| `LoadJson(path)` | the file, parsed. **The error names the file**, which is the whole reason to use it over `JSON.parse(File.Load(p))` — a syntax error in *something* is not an answer |
| `SaveJson(path, value)` | one canonical shape: indented by two, one trailing newline. Every `.form` and every `project.json` in this tree is written by it, which is why a file saved by the IDE and one written by hand look the same |
| `LoadXml(path)` | the file as a [`Xml`](../reference/globals/Xml.md) document. **The error names the file**, and the document's own declaration says what encoding it is in: this reads bytes, unlike `Load` |
| `SaveXml(path, node)` | the canonical XML shape, atomically, honouring neither locale nor encoding guesses |
| `Exists(path)`, `IsDir(path)` | `false` for anything that is not a string, rather than asking about a file called `undefined` |
| `Delete(path)` | a file, or an **empty** directory. Throws on failure |
| `Trash(path)` | to the desktop's trash, whole for a folder. Throws where there is no trash |
| `Rename(from, to)` | also moves; refuses to clobber |
| `LoadBytes(path)` | the whole file as [`Bytes`](#bytes), untouched — what `Load` cannot do, since it answers text |
| `SaveBytes(path, bytes)` | those bytes, exactly; the pair of `LoadBytes` |
| `Hash(path, [algorithm])` | the checksum as hex, `"Sha256"` unless told — see [`Hash`](../reference/globals/Hash.md). **Read in blocks**, so a video costs 64 KB of memory and not the video |
| `Copy(from, to)` | **byte for byte**, so it works on images; refuses to clobber |
| `Info(path)` | `{ Size, Modified, Type, Icon, IsDir }`, or `null`. `.Type` is a content type you can test (`"image/png"`), `.Icon` is the name the desktop draws for that kind of file, and `.Modified` is a real `Date`, to the millisecond |
| `Watch(path, cb)` | `cb(event, path)` — `"Changed"`, `"Created"`, `"Deleted"` — and answers something with a `Stop()` |
| `Open(path)` | hands the file to whatever the desktop opens that kind with. **It answers before the file is open**: launching is asynchronous and the program that opens it is somebody else's, so what this promises is that the request was made. A file that is not there is refused *here*, which is the failure a caller can do something about |
| `Join(a, b, …)`, `Absolute(path)` | |
| `Within(path, root)` | whether `path` is `root` or under it, by whole path components — `/a/proj2` is **not** inside `/a/proj` |
| `Relative(path, root)` | `path` with `root` taken off; the path unchanged when there is no relative spelling, and `""` for the root itself |
| `Name(path)` | `/a/b/c.js` → `c.js` |
| `Directory(path)` | `/a/b/c.js` → `/a/b` |
| `Extension(path)` | `js` — no dot, `""` when there is none |
| `IsExtension(path, ext)` | whether the name ends in that extension, **case-insensitively**. `"js"` and `".js"` are both taken, and a suffix like `"tar.gz"` is refused: the extension is what [`Extension`](../reference/globals/File.md#paths) answers, which stops at the last dot |
| `BaseName(path)` | `/a/b/c.js` → `c` |

`Within` and `Relative` are **lexical** and touch no disk, and they are the pair
`HasCommand`/`Exec` are: the question, and the spelling. The one thing they get
right that a hand-written prefix test does not is that a path is components:
`/home/u/proj2` starts with `/home/u/proj` and is not inside it. `.`, `..`, `//`
and a trailing slash are settled on the way in, and what is compared is the
canonical bytes -- `GFile`'s own rule, on every platform.

**`Trash` is what *Delete* usually should mean.** A program that offers Delete
and means `unlink` is harsher than the desktop it runs on — and one that offers
the trash needs no confirmation dialog, because the answer is recoverable. It
throws where the filesystem has no trash (a stick, tmpfs, a share); that is the
one case worth a confirmation.

`Info().Type` is a content type you can test (`"image/png"`); `.Icon` is the
name the desktop draws for that kind of file; `.Modified` is a real `Date`, to
the millisecond. `.Icon` is the one field that needs a display — in a console
project (`main`) it answers `""` and the other four still work.

`Watch` reports only settled events — a save is a burst, and many editors write
a temporary and rename it over. Both roads arrive as one `"Changed"`. A watch may
be stopped from inside its own callback.

Text is UTF-8 throughout, which is why `Copy` exists: `Save(to, Load(from))` is
right for source and destroys a PNG.

## Xml

```js
const doc = File.LoadXml("plan.xml");        // or Xml.Parse(text)
const tasks = doc.Root.Find("Tasks").FindAll("Task");

tasks[0].Find("Name").Text = "Analyse";      // or .SetAttr("Kind", "x")
File.SaveXml("plan.xml", doc);
```

**XML is a document and JSON is a value, and that is the whole design.** JSON
and JavaScript are the same model — object, list, scalar — which is why a
`Record` survives it; XML has attributes, order (an MSPDI schema is an
`xsd:sequence`), namespaces and mixed content, and none of those has anywhere to
go in a plain object. So `Xml.Parse` answers a tree, and a
[`Record`](#record-and-field) maps onto an element by **declaring** it —
[`static Xml`](#a-record-over-xml), beside what `Table` declares for a row.

| | |
|---|---|
| `Xml.Parse(text)` | the document, or a `SyntaxError` naming línea and columna |
| `Xml.ParseBytes(bytes)` | the same, and the declaration's encoding is honoured — what `File.LoadXml` uses |
| `Xml.Stringify(node)` | the canonical text: declaration, indented by two, one trailing newline. A detached element is written with a document of its own |
| `Xml.Element(name)` | a detached element; its own tree, not in any document |
| `Xml.Schema(source)` | compiles an XSD **once** -- from its text, a document or an element in one -- so a file can be checked as often as it arrives. A schema that includes or imports another document is refused, because compiling it would fetch a file or an URL from inside what is meant to be a check; `Validate` is the question and it never writes to the document |
| `XmlSchema.Validate(source)` | checks a document, or an element in one, against this schema. An empty array means valid; each problem carries the line it is on -- libxml2 reports the element and not a column, so `Column` is `0`. **Nothing is written into the document**, so a schema's default stays out of the tree and out of the next save |
| `Xml.Available` | whether this build has libxml2; the verbs refuse with a sentence when it does not |

A **document** answers `Root` (→ element, or `null`). An **element** answers:

| | |
|---|---|
| `Name`, `Prefix`, `Namespace` | the local name, the prefix, the URI — `""` when there is none |
| `Text` | all the character data under an element; assigning replaces the children. **Text XML cannot carry is refused**, naming the character: a NUL, a control character other than tab, newline and return, U+FFFE/FFFF or half a surrogate pair -- written, each was a document `Xml.Parse` could not read back, and a NUL cut the text short in silence |
| `Attr(name)` | the value of an attribute **with no namespace**, `""` for one that is present and empty, `null` for one that is not |
| `SetAttr(name, value)`, `RemoveAttr(name)` | both as text |
| `AttrNS(uri, name)`, `SetAttrNS(uri, name, value)`, `RemoveAttrNS(uri, name)` | the same for an attribute in a namespace — `xml:lang` is `AttrNS("http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace", "lang")`, since an unprefixed name means no namespace at all. `SetAttrNS` refuses a namespace not declared in scope |
| `AttributeNames()` | the local names, sorted as the file had them |
| `Children` | its element children, in order |
| `IsEmpty` | whether the element has nothing inside at all: no element, no text, no comment, no processing instruction. Attributes do not count. **The one question `Children` and `Text` cannot answer together** -- an element holding only a comment reads as both empty on them |
| `Comments` | the text of the comments directly under this element, in order -- what `Text` cannot carry, so a change to one can be reported |
| `Find(name)`, `FindAll(name)` | direct children by local name — `Find` answers `null` |
| `Add(child)`, `Insert(index, child)`, `Remove()` | see below |
| `Parent` | the parent element, or `null` for a root or a detached node |
| `Copy()` | a detached subtree of its own |
| `SetNamespace(uri, [prefix])` | puts the element in that namespace, reusing a declaration already in reach -- in a detached tree too, where it used to declare it again |
| `DeclareNamespace(uri, prefix)` | binds `prefix` to `uri` on this element, for its attributes and what is under it, **without putting the element in that namespace** -- what `SetAttrNS` then finds, as OOXML's `xmlns:r` on a workbook and `r:id` on each sheet. A prefix is required (a default namespace is `SetNamespace`'s); one already bound to the same URI in scope writes nothing, and one bound to another URI here or above is refused |

**A node from another tree is copied in, and `Add` answers the node that is in
*this* tree.** Within one tree `Add` moves, as a DOM does; across trees it
copies, because moving a subtree would have to repoint every wrapper under it
and one that was not repointed is a dangling pointer. The idiom that always
reads right is `const el = parent.Add(Xml.Element("Task"))`. `Remove()` takes the
node out and *that* wrapper stops answering — `Copy()` first to keep it; another
wrapper of the same element still answers, detached, and can `Add` it back.
`SetNamespace` twice with one URI is one declaration; another URI for a prefix
the element already declares throws, naming the one it has.
`DeclareNamespace(uri, prefix)` binds a prefix without moving the element, which is
how `r:id` is written (`book.DeclareNamespace(RELS, "r")`, then `SetAttrNS(RELS, "id",
…)` on a sheet); one bound to another URI in scope is refused. **An element added
under a default namespace takes it**, with what is under it -- the tree says what the
text will. **What `Xml` writes, `Xml` reads**: `Text`, `SetAttr` and `SetAttrNS` refuse a
NUL, a control character other than tab/newline/return, U+FFFE/FFFF and half a
surrogate pair, naming it -- each used to be written into a document `Xml.Parse`
refused, and a NUL cut the text short in silence.
A broken name (`Add("a b")`) throws rather than writing a document no parser can
read.

**The canonical shape is `SaveJson`'s decision repeated.** A parsed document is
rebuilt with a declaration, indentation of two and a trailing newline, so
whitespace between elements and the order of attributes are not preserved —
both are insignificant to XML, and one shape is worth more than byte fidelity.
Comments are nodes in the tree and are written back where they were. An element
that is present but empty is *not* something the canonical writer can promise:
an empty text is what a field starts from, which is the record mapper's
business and not the DOM's.

**A document can be checked against its schema before anything reads it.**
`Xml.Schema` compiles the XSD once — 70-90 ms for the 240 KB MSPDI schema — and
`Validate` is the cheap question (`~2.9 us` a task, 23 ms for eight thousand).
An empty array is valid; a problem is data, with the line and a sentence, not an
exception. The schema has to be **self-contained**: an `xs:include`, an
`xs:redefine` or an `xs:import` with a `schemaLocation` is refused, because
compiling it would fetch a file or an URL from inside what is meant to be a
check. Validation never writes to the document.

```js
const xsd = File.Load("mspdi_pj12.xsd")
                .split("http://schemas.microsoft.com/project/2007")
                .join("http://schemas.microsoft.com/project");
const schema = Xml.Schema(xsd);
const plan   = File.LoadXml("plan.xml");

for (const p of schema.Validate(plan))
    print(`${p.Line}: ${p.Message}`);
```

That replacement is the caller's, and it is there because the official schema
declares a namespace the files do not write — see `docs/plans/xml-plan.md`.

**Nothing here reads a DTD, an entity, a schema or the network.** Parsed with
`XML_PARSE_NONET` and without entity substitution or DTD loading, so an external
entity, a billion laughs and a 2 GB text node are negatives rather than
configurations to get right; a document that is not well formed throws with its
position, and nothing goes to stderr. HTML is not XML and is not this.
`XPath` and a streaming reader are deliberately absent — each is a language or
a contract of its own, and `docs/plans/xml-plan.md` names the trigger that would
bring each back.

XML is **optional at build time**, like `Database.Sqlite`: without libxml2,
`Xml.Available` is `false` and every verb refuses naming the package. The class
is installed in a worker too, so a big file can be parsed off the main thread.

## Directory

| | |
|---|---|
| `List(path, [pattern])` | the **names**, sorted, with no `.` or `..` — what a tree of one folder shows |
| `Files(path, [pattern-or-options])` | the **full paths** of the files, sorted |
| `Folders(path, [pattern-or-options])` | the same for the directories |
| `Make(path)` | creates it **and any missing parent**, so there is no loop to write |

Every path is a string, refused otherwise — see [File](#file).
| `Copy(from, to)`, `Delete(path)`, `DeleteTree(path)` | |

```js
Directory.Files(dir)
Directory.Files(dir, "*.form")
Directory.Files(dir, { Pattern: "*.c", Recursive: true })
Directory.Folders(dir, { Recursive: true })
```

Sorted at each level and depth-first, so two runs list the same tree the same
way. A symlinked directory is listed and not entered; a symlink to a file is an
ordinary file.

**All three throw when the path is not a directory** — `cannot list <path>` — and
do not answer an empty list. Ask `File.IsDir(path)` first. What *is* forgiven is a
directory the walk finds and cannot read: that one is skipped rather than ending
the walk.

## Probe

What a file *is*, read from its header **without decoding it** — no widget, no
display, no pixels in memory.

```js
Probe.Image("logo.png")          // { Width: 640, Height: 200 }
Probe.Image("notes.txt")         // null
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Image(path)` | the picture's pixels, from its header. `null` when `path` is not a picture this machine's loaders read -- exactly the files a `Picture` would not show, an `.svg` included where no SVG loader is installed, and its declared size where one is -- or is not there. **A file's header and nothing else**: the size of a picture already in memory is the handle's to answer, off the decode it already did. **No widget and no display**, which is what makes it answerable in a `main` project and before anything has been drawn |

The size is in pixels; a vector picture answers the size it declares (an SVG's
`viewBox`). **It reads exactly the files a [`Picture`](controls.md#picture)
shows**, because both go through the machine's image loaders — so which formats
answer is the machine's, not the runtime's: an SVG is measured where an SVG
loader is installed (Fedora reads one through glycin) and is `null` where none is,
and `null` from here means a `Picture` would have shown nothing. `null` is also
the answer for a file that is not there, as `File.Info` gives; a path that is not
text is **refused**, so `Probe.Image(undefined)` never probes `./undefined`.

**It is not `File.ImageSize`**, on purpose: `File` is for working *on* a file —
loading, saving, hashing, watching — and `File.Info` already answers a `Type`, so
a second question about the same file under `File` would be a second answer for
one word. A probe is what `ffprobe`, `exiftool` and `identify` call reading a
header, and the namespace grows by the *kind* of thing (`Image` now). A worker
has it: a report sizing a logo on a thread is what it was for.

## Exec

```js
Exec(["git", "status", "--short"],
     (line) => this.Log.Append(line + "\n"),
     (code) => this.done(code));
```

`argv` is an array, **never** a shell string: there is no shell to quote for, so
a file name with spaces cannot turn into a command. stdout and stderr are merged,
read asynchronously and split into lines. Both callbacks are optional.

**This plus a read-only [`TextEditor`](controls.md#texteditor) is a log pane**,
and it is what to reach for rather than a `Terminal`: `Append` writes at the end
and scrolls there whatever the cursor was doing, and it works with `ReadOnly` on.
A pty buys typing, colour and `less`; if the program does none of those, it is a
dependency paid for nothing. The IDE's own output pane is exactly this. The exit
callback runs only once **both pipes have seen EOF**, so everything the child
printed is already in the buffer when it does.

An options object may come between the argv and the callbacks:

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `Directory` | where to start the child |
| `Environment` | names to add or change; a `null` value **removes** one. A change, not a replacement. A value that cannot become text is refused by the call, not skipped |
| `Stderr` | `"separate"` keeps the streams apart — the line callback then gets `"out"`/`"err"` as its second argument. Merged is the default, and merging is what keeps the order |
| `Timeout` | milliseconds before the child is ended; absent waits forever |
| `KillAfter` | milliseconds between SIGTERM and SIGKILL, `5000` by default |
| `Input` | **`Wait` only**: the text or `Bytes` the child reads, before its stdin is closed. What makes `Exec.Wait(["sort"], { Input: text })` a filter |

The handle: `ProcessId`, `Running`, `ExitCode` (`null` while it runs; `-1` for a
child stopped by a signal), `TimedOut`, `Stop()` (SIGTERM), `Kill()` (SIGKILL),
`Write(text)` (a line to its stdin; a newline is added when there is not one,
and it answers whether there was still a child to write to), `CloseInput()` (the
end of its stdin, after what `Write` queued -- what tells `sort`, `wc` or `jq`
that the input is over). `Write` is queued and never blocks, so a child that
echoes what it reads cannot hang the program; and `Stop`/`Kill`/`Timeout` still
reach a grandchild that holds the output after the leader has exited.

A child that speaks a protocol as well as printing gets a stream of its own:
`Control` in the options is a callback for the child's **descriptor 3**, one
line at a time. stdout is what a child says to a person, so a protocol must not
share it -- a child that printed the marker would break its own tooling.
The run is over when stdout has drained and the child has exited, not when
descriptor 3 closes, so a line written there after that -- by a grandchild
still holding it, say -- is dropped: the exit callback has already run.
Both signal the child's whole process group, so a wrapper's children go too.

```js
const job = Exec(["make", "-j4"], { Directory: build, Timeout: 180000 },
                 (line) => print(line), (code) => print(`done ${code}`));
job.Stop();
```

### Exec.Wait

```js
const r = Exec.Wait(["msgfmt", "--check", po]);
r.ExitCode          // the status
r.Output            // everything it wrote
r.Errors            // only with { Stderr: "separate" }
r.TimedOut          // with a Timeout
// Output is the bytes the child wrote, whole: a NUL in it is part of the
// answer, which is what `git status -z` and `find -print0` need.
```

The blocking spelling, for a tool that runs a command it knows ends, looks at
what happened, and goes on. Same options, **no callbacks**. It turns N children
in a row into an ordinary `for` loop.

**It freezes the window** — nothing paints and nothing responds until the child
exits, and that is also what makes it safe: no handler runs inside the wait.
Without a `Timeout` a command that never ends hangs the program. Use it for
`msgmerge`, `git status`, `tar`. For anything long, use the callback spelling;
for anything genuinely interactive, a [`Terminal`](controls.md#terminal) — which
this build may not have, so ask `Widget.Available("Terminal")` first.

## Task

A class that runs in a thread of its own. For a computation too long for the
loop and too fine-grained for a child: totals over a hundred thousand rows
while the window stays alive.

```js
class Sizer extends Task {
    Run(msg) {
        // ... walk msg.roots ...
        return { size, files };
    }
}

const t = new Sizer();
t.Done = (r) => show(r);
t.Error = (m, stack) => complain(m);
t.Start({ roots: subs });
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Start(data, [options])` | serialises the message, loads the class's file in a fresh runtime on a fresh thread, builds the class, and calls `Run(msg)`. **Once** — a second `Start` is refused; work that repeats is a new `Task` |
| `Stop([{ KillAfter }])` | **asks** it to end, and enforces `KillAfter` ms later (5000 by default, 0 = at once). Two stages like `Exec`'s guard. Answers whether there was a live job to ask |
| `Report(value)` | the worker's voice, called from `Run`; arrives as `Progress`. `this.Report` on a proxy is refused |
| `Stopping` | inside `Run`: `true` once `Stop()` has asked, so the job can `Report` what it has and return. Delphi's `Terminated`, BackgroundWorker's `CancellationPending` |
| `Done` | assign `(result) => …`. Called once, with what `Run` returned |
| `Error` | assign `(message, stack) => …`. Called once, when `Run` threw, the job was stopped (`Cancelled`), or it timed out |
| `Progress` | assign `(partial) => …`. Zero or more calls, in order, all before `Done` |
| `Running` | `false` once it has ended — written before `Done`/`Error` run, like `Exec`'s |
| `Cancelled` | whether `Stop()` is what ended it |
| `TimedOut` | whether the guard is what ended it |

`Task` itself is abstract: `new Task()` throws, and so does starting a class
the project has no file for. Options: `{ Timeout }` in milliseconds, absent
waits forever.

**One answer, exactly once.** `Done` xor `Error`, however the job went — a
stopped task reports `Cancelled` rather than going quiet, the way a stopped
`Exec` still runs its exit callback. Which ending it was is read off
`Cancelled` and `TimedOut`, never by matching on the message. Tell a stale answer from a live one the
way `examples/usage` does: a generation counter, and the old run's answers are
dropped where they arrive.

**A message is plain data**: objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, null
— plus `Decimal`, which crosses as its own digits and arrives as a real one
(same class, same file, so `(10/3)*3` is `10` on both sides). Functions, class
instances, cycles, `undefined` and `Bytes` are refused out loud rather than
silently subsetted; a `Record` crosses as what `Serialize` writes and comes
back through `Load`.

**A worker is this language, not a subset of it.** Its context is built the
way the main one is — the same `init` functions, then the same `rad.js` — so
`Decimal`, `Bytes`, `Dictionary`, `Regex`, `Stopwatch`, `Record`, `Field` and
`Table` are all there, with `print`, `Logger`, `Day`/`Time`, `Hash`,
`File`/`Directory` for reading, `Database`/`Sqlite`, and an `Application` that
answers facts.

**What it lacks is what would leave a callback on the main loop** — not what
writes. Gone: every widget and `Dialog`/`Message`/`Clipboard`/`Screen` (GTK
off the main thread is a crash), `Exec`, `File.Watch`, `Timer` and async
`Http` (the source would fire on the main thread holding this context), and
`Settings` (process state the main thread owns). **`Locale` is there with its
facts and not its catalogue**: `Compare`, `Matches`, `Number`, `Date`,
`Currency`, `Parse` and `DecimalPoint` read the process locale, which every
thread inherits, while `Text`/`Plural`/`Context`/`Current`/`Available` read a
table the main thread fills and reloads — so a worker orders ten thousand
names, which is what it was started for, and cannot translate one.

**And the debugger does not reach in here.** `bintana --debug` installs its hook
on the program's own runtime; a worker's is a second `JSRuntime` on a second
thread with nothing attached to it, and the channel is one pipe to one process.
A `Task` is therefore **unbreakpointable and unsteppable** — `Report` from
inside `Run` is as close as anything comes to watching one, and `Error` with
its stack is the whole of what its failure says. The same is true of a program
that never left the main thread and only went wrong inside the worker, which is
the usual shape of this: what to check is `Lock` and the `Stop()`/`KillAfter`
dance, not a breakpoint that cannot be set.

**A worker writes.** `File.Save` renames a temporary over its target, so two
threads saving one path cannot tear it; what concurrency costs here is the
lost update (read, change, write from two threads and the first change is
gone), and that is a *sequence* only the program can mark — `Lock.Hold(name,
fn)`, not a guard the runtime can put on a call.
[`examples/usage`](https://github.com/getbintana/bintana/tree/main/examples/usage) is the whole of it running: N tasks
sizing N subtrees, one window adding up.

## Lock

Taking turns, by name. One member.

```js
Lock.Hold("accounts", () => {
    const book = File.LoadJson(path);
    File.SaveJson(path, add(book, row));
});
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Hold(name, fn)` | runs `fn` with the named lock held and releases it — whether `fn` returned, threw, or was interrupted. Answers nothing |

**Not for keeping a file whole** — `File.Save` renames a temporary over its
target, so two threads saving one path cannot tear it. It is for the **lost
update**: read, change, write from two threads and the first change is gone,
because the gap is *between* two calls. Measured with four `Task`s adding to
one counter: 68 of 240 without the hold, 240 of 240 with it.

**Named and not held**, because a `Task` runs in a runtime of its own and no
object crosses a message — Win32's `CreateMutex(..., "Global\Accounts")`
rather than .NET's `lock (obj)`. **Recursive**, so a nested hold of one name is
not a deadlock. **Answers nothing**, because a critical section is a statement
everywhere else; read a value out through a variable. **A callback and not
`Enter`/`Leave`**, which is correctness here: a forced `Stop()` ends a task at
an arbitrary point, so a `Leave` would never run.

On the main thread a `Hold` freezes the window while it waits, like
`Exec.Wait` — short, or not there. Two locks taken in two orders deadlock here
as everywhere.

## Dialog

- `Dialog.OpenFile(title, [options], cb)`
- `Dialog.SaveFile(title, [options], cb)`
- `Dialog.SelectFolder(title, [options], cb)`
- `Dialog.Color(title, current, cb)`

**The callback is required** — passing none throws — and it is **not called when
the user cancels**, so no caller has to tell *cancelled* from *chose nothing*.

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `Folder` | where the chooser opens |
| `Name` | the name it starts on |
| `Filters` | `[label, patterns]` pairs; patterns space separated. The first is the one it opens on |

```js
Dialog.SaveFile(Locale.Text("Save as"),
    { Folder: Application.Directory, Name: "note.txt",
      Filters: [[Locale.Text("Text"), "*.txt"], [Locale.Text("All files"), "*"]] },
    (path) => File.Save(path, this.Editor.Text));
```

A filter's label is prose you own: wrap it in `Locale.Text`. `Dialog.Color`
answers an `rgb(...)`/`rgba(...)` string, which is exactly what `Background`
takes.

## Printer

- `Printer.Send(area, [setup], cb)` — the print dialog, then a printer. **Async**
- `Printer.ToFile(area, path, [setup])` — a PDF, with **no dialog**
- `Printer.Names` — the printers this machine has, or `null` if it cannot say
- `Printer.Default` — the one it would use, `""` for none, `null` if it cannot say
- `Printer.Papers` — the paper sizes, in points

`area` is a control that draws — a `DrawingArea`, or the `Canvas` of a `Report`
or a `Markdown`. Its handler runs once per sheet against the print context: the
same cairo calls that paint the screen, so a page that fits the paper in
`SavePdf` fits it here. The frame is the printable area in **points**, 72 to the
inch.

**How many sheets there are is asked, not assumed.** `Pages` is the caller's
count against the paper *it* had; a control that declares
`Paginate(width, height)` is asked again once the dialog has settled, and
`Printer` prints what it answers. Without it a viewer laid out for A4 printed
four sheets on A5 and dropped the two that did not fit.

**Two verbs and not one with a destination**, the way `OpenFile` and `SaveFile`
are two. A file has no copies: `Copies` on `ToFile` is refused rather than
accepted and quietly ignored — which is what the one-verb version did, answering
"three copies sent" and writing the same bytes as one.

| Setup | |
|---|---|
| `Pages` | how many the document is, 1 to 10000. Default 1 |
| `Paper` | `A4`, `Letter` or `A5` |
| `Orientation` | `Portrait` or `Landscape` |
| `From`, `To` | the range within the document. `To` defaults to the last page |
| `Copies` | **`Send` only** |

`Send` **takes a callback and returns at once**, like every other dialog here
(`Dialog.OpenFile`, `SaveFile`, `Color`): the person answers in their own time.
`cb({ Copies, From, To })` is called when something was printed and **is not
called when it was cancelled** — so no caller has to tell *cancelled* from
*printed nothing*. One control prints once at a time; a second `Send` on the same
control while one is in flight is refused by name.

`ToFile` opens no dialog, so it is synchronous and answers how many pages it
wrote. A page whose handler throws stops the run, and on the file road leaves
**no file**.

```js
Sheet_DrawPage(p, page, w, h) {
    p.Text(Locale.Text("Page {0} of {1}", page, this.total), 40, 60);
}

BtnPrint_Click() {
    Printer.Send(this.Sheet, { Pages: this.total, Paper: "A4" }, (sent) => {
        Message.Info("{0} copies, pages {1} to {2}", sent.Copies, sent.From, sent.To);
    });
}
```

`Printer.Papers` is `{ A4: { Width, Height }, Letter: …, A5: … }` in points,
read off GTK rather than written down — the **one** table, which is why
`lib/report` and `lib/markdown` no longer each carry a copy. They did, and
both called it `PAPERS` at the top level, so a project that named both
libraries did not start.

**`Names` and `Default` have three answers**, because there are three states:
the printers, `[]` for a machine that has none, and **`null` for a session that
cannot ask at all** — they are GTK's Unix print backend, which is an optional
module. `null` and not a throw, and not `[]`: a program that wants to know asks,
rather than finding out by catching something. Printing itself is unaffected —
the dialog is core GTK — and neither is cached, because the printers a machine
has change while a program runs.

```js
const printers = Printer.Names;
if (printers === null)      … // this build cannot say
else if (!printers.length)  … // it can, and there are none
```

## Drawing

A [`Painter`](controls.md#painter) over a PNG or a PDF **with no control and no
display** — what a `main` project draws a document with, since it cannot make a
widget at all. `DrawingArea`'s three ways out, with the drawing passed where the
control was:

```js
Drawing.Save("load.png", 800, 400, (p, w, h) => chart.Paint(p, w, h));
const png = Drawing.ToPng(800, 400, (p, w, h) => { p.Text("Nightly", 10, 10); });
Drawing.SavePdf("report.pdf", 595, 842, pages, (p, page, w, h) => report.Paint(p, page, w, h));
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Save(path, width, height, draw)` | `draw(painter, width, height)` against an image of that size, written as a PNG — `DrawingArea.Save` with the handler passed in place of the control, so it needs **no widget and no display**. Ink black, the font `Text` measures with. A `draw` that throws writes no file, and the throw is this call's |
| `ToPng(width, height, draw)` | the same picture as `Save`, answered as `Bytes` instead of written |
| `SavePdf(path, width, height, pages, draw)` | `draw(painter, page, width, height)` once per page into one **PDF** — `DrawingArea.SavePdf` with the drawing passed in place of the control, and `DrawPage`'s own arguments. The size is in **points**, 72 to the inch (A4 is 595×842); `pages` may be `undefined` for one. What a `main` project prints with: **no widget and no display**. A page that throws leaves **no file** |

`draw` is called the way a handler is: `(painter, width, height)` for a picture —
`Draw`'s arguments — and `(painter, page, width, height)` once per page of a PDF,
1-based — `DrawPage`'s. So a drawing written for a control is the drawing for
this, and `lib/report`'s `ReportDocument` and `lib/charts`' `ChartDocument` draw
through it.

**What the painter has with no control behind it**: **black** ink and a line one
wide — a control's ink is its theme's, and a document has none, so a chart drawn
here is readable on white paper whatever the desktop is — and the font
[`Text`](#text) measures with, at the resolution it measures at, so a page laid
out with `Text.Size` is drawn at the size it was measured. A new painter per
call, valid only while `draw` runs: one kept past it refuses every call.

**A throw from `draw` is this call's throw**, unlike a control's handler (an
event, reported as one): the caller is on the stack. It **leaves no file** — a
PDF is written as it is drawn, and a half-written one is removed. The sizes,
the pages and the refusals are `DrawingArea`'s: a picture up to 16384 a side, a
page in **points** up to PDF's 200 inches, 1 to 10000 pages, and `pages` may be
`undefined` for one. Not in a `Task`: a worker installs no painter.

## Settings

What the application remembers between runs — anything JSON carries, in
`Application.ConfigDirectory/settings.json`, written on every change.

`Get(key, fallback)`, `Set(key, value)`, `Has(key)`, `Delete(key)`, `Keys()`,
`Clear()`, `Path`.

```js
Settings.Set("recent", [dir, ...Settings.Get("recent", [])].slice(0, 8));
if (Settings.Get("showGrid", true)) …
```

The fallback matters: `Get("on", true)` tells a missing setting from one that is
`false`. Named after the project, so two projects never read each other's.

## Timer

```js
Timer.After(250, () => this.LblStatus.Text = "");     // once
const clock = Timer.Every(1000, () => this.tick());   // repeat
clock.Stop();
```

Both hand the `Timer` back, so what was started can be stopped. **The delay
comes first and has to be a number, and the tick has to be a function**: both
used to be taken whatever they were, so `Timer.After(fn, 300)` ran nothing ever
and `Timer.Every("abc", fn)` ran on every turn of the loop. `Infinity` is about
forty-nine days, which is what never means to a timer. The full object:
`new Timer(delay, tick)`, `Delay`, `Tick`, `Enabled`, `Start([delay])`,
`Stop()`, `Once([delay])`.

This **is** scheduling here: `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are not part of the
language. `Timer.After(0, …)` is also how you let GTK have a frame before
measuring anything.

## Stopwatch

How long something took, which is the one question a `Date` cannot answer — a
wall clock is a setting, and NTP stepping it mid-measurement makes the answer
wrong or negative.

`Elapsed` (milliseconds, with the fraction, running or not), `Running`,
`Start()`, `Stop()`, `Reset()`. All three return the watch, so
`new Stopwatch().Start()` is one line.

**A tick decides when to repaint; what is painted comes from `Elapsed`.** Adding
100 per 100 ms tick falls behind and never catches up.

## Profile

What a Sysprof capture carries, and how an application marks its own work.
Installed in every run and **inert unless a profiler is listening**: with no
`--profile` and not under Sysprof, `Active` is `false` and the verbs do nothing.

`Active` (whether marks are going anywhere), `Begin(name)`, `End(name)`,
`Mark(name)`, `Counter(name, value)`. `Begin`/`End` is one span of the stretch
between them — what a sampled profile cannot say, since QuickJS interprets and
a native stack never names the `.js` function that was running. `End` closes
the innermost `Begin` and refuses a name that does not match, since the wrong
order would put one span's time on another's. `Mark` is one instant.
`Counter` is one number on a track of its own — rows loaded, a queue's depth —
defined the first time the name is seen and updated after. See
[Profiling](https://github.com/getbintana/bintana/blob/main/docs/installing.md#profiling).

## Dictionary

What a bag of data holds. `for...in` recites, `Dictionary` counts.

`Keys(bag)`, `Values(bag)`, `Entries(bag)` (`[{ Key, Value }, …]`), `Count(bag)`,
`Has(bag, key)`. When the keys are numbers, use a `Map`.

## Hash

A checksum, of a string or of a file.

```js
Hash.Sha256("abc")                       // ba7816bf…f20015ad
File.Hash(path)                          // the same digest, over the file
File.Hash(path, "md5")
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Md5(v)`, `Sha1(v)`, `Sha256(v)`, `Sha512(v)` | the digest as lower-case hex. `v` is text (hashed as its UTF-8) or a [`Bytes`](#bytes) (hashed as the bytes it is) |
| `Hmac(key, message, [algorithm])` | the keyed digest (RFC 2104) as lower-case hex, `"Sha256"` unless told. `key` and `message` are text (its UTF-8) or a [`Bytes`](#bytes), and **nothing else**: a number or `undefined` is refused rather than signed as the word it spells. For a signature somebody sent you, **do not compare the answer with `===`** -- that is what `Verify` is for |
| `Verify(key, message, signature, [algorithm])` | whether `signature` is the keyed digest of `message`, compared in constant time. `signature` is hex (either case) or a [`Bytes`](#bytes) of the raw digest; text that is not hex of the right length is `false`, not an error, since it is what a forged one looks like. Never answers by throwing for a wrong signature |
| `File.Hash(path, [algorithm])` | the checksum as hex, `"Sha256"` unless told — see [`Hash`](../reference/globals/Hash.md). **Read in blocks**, so a video costs 64 KB of memory and not the video |

**What is hashed is the text's UTF-8 bytes**, which is what every other tool
means by the hash of a string: `Hash.Sha256("abc")` is what `sha256sum` says
about a file holding `abc`, and `Hash.Sha256("ñandú")` agrees with it too.
Something that is not text has to become text first — `JSON.stringify`, a
`Decimal`'s own digits — and which text is part of what was hashed, so it is the
caller's decision and not a default.

`File.Hash` reads the file in blocks and never holds it: the digest of a video
costs 64 KB of memory. It is also the one to use for anything that is not text,
since `File.Load` answers a string and a JPEG is not one.

**A keyed digest is how a message is signed, and the comparison is where it goes
wrong.** `Hash.Hmac("secret", body)` is the signature a webhook carries; checking
one with `===` answers faster the more leading characters are right, which is
enough to forge it. `Hash.Verify("secret", body, signature)` compares in constant
time, takes the signature as hex (either case) or as `Bytes`, and answers `false`
— not an error — for text that is not a signature at all. The key and the message
are text or `Bytes` and **nothing else**: a number or `undefined` is refused
rather than signed as the word it spells.

```js
if (!Hash.Verify(Settings.Get("webhook"), req.Body, req.Headers["x-signature"], "Sha256"))
    return req.Answer(401, "no");
```

[`examples/webhook`](https://github.com/getbintana/bintana/tree/main/examples/webhook) runs the whole scheme, with the six deliveries a
receiver has to tell apart.

**A hash is not a password.** These are checksums — same input, same digest, as
fast as the machine can go, which is what makes them right for comparing a
download against a published digest, keying a cache, or telling two files apart,
and wrong for storing what somebody typed. There is no salt, no work factor and
no `bcrypt` here.

## Random

Numbers a program cannot predict, from the operating system. **`Math.random` is
not a source for a token, a session id or a nonce**; this is.

```js
Random.Bytes(32)            // Bytes: a key, a nonce, a token's worth
Random.Bytes(16).ToHex()    // a hex token
Random.Int(1, 6)            // 1 to 6, both ends included
Random.Uuid()               // "3f1c0a9e-5b7d-4c2e-9a1f-0d8e6b4a2c10"
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Bytes(count)` | `count` bytes from the operating system's source, 0 to 1,048,576. **The one to make a token, a key or a nonce from** -- `Math.random` is not. Throws, and never falls back to something weaker, if the system has no randomness to give |
| `Int(min, max)` | a whole number from `min` to `max`, **both ends included**, every value exactly as likely. Throws for ends that are not whole numbers, for `min` above `max`, and for a range wider than 2^53 |
| `Uuid()` | a version 4 UUID in its lower-case 8-4-4-4-12 spelling, from the same source as `Bytes`. Random, so it does not sort by creation: as a database key it scatters an index |

**It throws rather than fall back.** If the system has no randomness to give, the
call fails — there is no weaker source behind it, because a silent one is the bug.
`Bytes` takes 0 to 1,048,576. `Int` is **unbiased** (every value exactly as likely,
not `r % span`), takes whole numbers within 2^53 and refuses `min` above `max`.
`Uuid()` is random, so it **does not sort by creation**: as a database key it
scatters an index. A worker has all three.

## Gzip

The one compression format, on the zlib that GIO already links.

```js
const z = Gzip.Compress("some text")                  // Bytes
Gzip.Decompress(z).ToText()                           // "some text"
Gzip.CompressFile(path, path + ".gz")                 // streamed; answers the bytes written
Gzip.DecompressFile(path + ".gz", path)
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Compress(data, [{ Level }])` | `data` (text as its UTF-8, or a [`Bytes`](#bytes)) as one gzip member. `Level` is 1 (fast) to 9 (small), 6 unless told. A second option, or a value that is neither text nor `Bytes`, is refused. About 50 MB a second: a big one belongs in a [`Task`](#task) |
| `Decompress(bytes, [{ MaxSize }])` | what `bytes` holds, **all of it**: members glued together are read to the end, a stream that stops inside one **throws** (naming how far it got) rather than answering what it had, and so does anything that is not gzip. The answer may not pass `MaxSize` bytes (256 MiB unless told), because a few kilobytes can inflate to gigabytes. Text comes out as `ToText()` of the answer |
| `CompressFile(source, destination, [{ Level }])` | gzips a file into another **without loading it**, 64 KB at a time, and answers the bytes written. The destination appears only when it is whole: a failure leaves no half-written file, and an existing one is untouched |
| `DecompressFile(source, destination, [{ MaxSize }])` | the reverse, streamed, with the same ceiling and the same promise about the destination. Answers the bytes written |

**`Decompress` answers all of it or throws.** Several members glued together
(`cat a.gz b.gz`, which is valid gzip) are read to the end; a stream that stops
inside a member throws and says how far it got, instead of returning the half it
had; anything that is not gzip, and bytes after the last member, throw too.

**The output has a ceiling**, `MaxSize` (256 MiB unless told), because a few
kilobytes can inflate to gigabytes and a body off the network is exactly where
that arrives. Raise it for data you trust. An option the verb does not know is
refused, so `{ Lvel: 9 }` does not quietly mean level 6.

**The file verbs never leave half a file.** The destination appears only when the
stream is whole; a failure removes the temporary and an existing destination is
untouched. The new file keeps the old one's permissions, as `gzip` does.

About 50 MB a second to compress and 500 to decompress: a big one belongs in a
[`Task`](#task), which has it. Compressed data is not text — `Decompress` takes
`Bytes`, and `ToText()` is the way back to a string. There is no zlib framing,
raw deflate or zip here; the name goes out when something needs it.
[`examples/backup`](https://github.com/getbintana/bintana/tree/main/examples/backup) is the file verbs in use, with every copy read back.

## Keyring

The system's secret store, through the freedesktop Secret Service: a token, a
password or a key kept where the desktop keeps them, instead of in a file.

```js
Keyring.Available
Keyring.Store(Application.Id, "https://zbx.lan/zabbix", token, (ok) => { … })
Keyring.Lookup(Application.Id, "https://zbx.lan/zabbix", (value) => { … })
Keyring.Delete(Application.Id, "https://zbx.lan/zabbix", (ok) => { … })
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Available` | whether this build has libsecret. It says nothing about whether the machine is running a secret service -- a headless session has none -- so a caller treats a failed `Lookup` like an empty vault |
| `Store(service, key, value, cb)` | puts `value` in the system's keyring under `service` and `key`, and calls `cb(ok)` when the vault answers -- `false` when it could not store it, which is what a machine with no secret service says. The label a keyring browser shows is made of the two names |
| `Lookup(service, key, cb)` | reads what `Store` saved, and calls `cb(value)` -- the text, or `null` when nothing is stored **or** the vault cannot be asked |
| `Delete(service, key, cb)` | forgets it, and calls `cb(ok)`: `false` when there was nothing under those names or the vault could not be asked. Deleting what is not there is not an error |

**The calls are asynchronous, and they have to be.** The vault is a service on
the session bus, and it may be locked: a synchronous lookup would freeze every
window and every timer until the user answered a prompt. So each verb takes a
callback and returns at once, and the answer arrives on the loop. A callback
takes **one value** — whether it worked, or the secret — so an error is folded
into that value.

**`service` names the program and `key` the thing within it**, so one
application holds one secret per server: a Zabbix token is
`Keyring.Store(Application.Id, url, token, cb)`. The label is data and not
prose: nothing here goes through a catalogue.

**Optional at build time**: without libsecret `Keyring` exists, `Available` is
`false` and every verb refuses naming the package. A desktop with no service
running is the same answer at run time, which `Available` cannot see — a caller
treats a failed `Lookup` like an empty vault and keeps its own fallback. A
`main` project can use it and the console loop waits for the answer; a `Task`
cannot, because the callback belongs to the main loop.

## Zip

The container every office document, ebook and jar is: read it, and write one.

```js
const z = Zip.Open("accounts.xlsx");
for (const e of z.Entries) print(e.Name, e.Size);
const sheet = Xml.ParseBytes(z.Read("xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml"));
z.ExtractAll("/tmp/accounts");
z.Close();

const out = Zip.Create("report.xlsx");
out.Add("[Content_Types].xml", types).Add("xl/workbook.xml", book).AddFile("media/logo.png", logo);
out.Finish();
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Open(path)` | reads the archive's directory and answers a handle on it. Throws, naming the file and the reason, for anything that is not a zip, is cut short, is zip64 or split over disks, or lists one name twice. An archive up to 32 MiB is held in memory; a bigger one is mapped, so do not open one that is still being written |
| `Create(path)` | starts an archive that will be at `path` **when `Finish()` says so** and not before: it is written to a temporary beside it, so a failure, an abort or a dropped writer leaves nothing and an existing file untouched. Throws, naming the folder, when it cannot write there |
| `Entries` | what the archive holds |
| `Read(name, [{ MaxSize }])` | one entry's bytes |
| `Extract(name, path, [{ MaxSize }])` | one entry written to a path |
| `ExtractAll(folder, [{ MaxSize }])` | every entry under a folder |
| `Close()` | lets go of the archive |
| `Add(name, [data], [{ Store, Modified }])` | puts an entry in the archive being written |
| `AddFile(name, path, [{ Store, Modified }])` | the same for a file, streamed |
| `Finish()` | writes the directory and puts the archive at its path |
| `Abort()` | throws the archive away |

**Whatever is read is checked, and a failure throws rather than answers.** Every entry's
CRC-32 is verified; an entry that inflates to more than its directory says, whose local
header names something else than the directory does, or that is over `MaxSize`
(256 MiB unless told) is refused with a sentence naming it. A name listed twice refuses
the whole archive at `Open`, because which of two an application reads is not something
to leave to chance.

**Names are checked before they are paths.** `ExtractAll` refuses an archive holding an
entry that would leave its folder — `../x`, an absolute path, a drive letter, a backslash,
an empty part, a NUL — **before it writes a byte**, so a refusal leaves nothing and not
half an archive. Only files and folders are ever made, never a link.

**Refused by name, and nothing else is:** encryption, zip64 (past 4 GiB or 65,535 entries),
a multi-disk archive, and any method but stored and deflate. An encrypted *entry* does not
stop the others being read. Measured on 49 real documents (859 entries) every one was
stored or deflated and none used any of the rest — and 31 % of the entries carry a data
descriptor, which is why the sizes come from the directory at the end and not from the
header in front of the data. Names are UTF-8.

`Modified` is a `Date` in local time (a zip has no zone and counts in two seconds).
An archive up to 32 MiB is held in memory; a bigger one is mapped, so do not open a zip
that is still being written. A worker has `Zip`, and the handle stays in the thread that
opened it.

**Writing: nothing is at the path until `Finish()`.** The archive is written to a temporary
beside it and renamed into place last, so a failure, an `Abort()` or a writer that is dropped
leaves nothing and an existing file untouched. `Add` takes the names `ExtractAll` accepts and
refuses the ones it refuses — `../x`, an absolute path, a drive letter, a backslash, an empty
part, a NUL — and a name twice, so what is written here is a zip nobody can be hurt by
extracting. Entries are deflated **unless that did not make them smaller** or `Store: true` (an
`.odt`'s `mimetype`, first); `AddFile` streams and cannot see whether it helped, so it costs a
few bytes on an incompressible file. No zip64: past 65,534 entries or 4 GiB is refused.

[`examples/sheets`](https://github.com/getbintana/bintana/tree/main/examples/sheets) reads an `.xlsx` in a `Task` and shows it in a table that
holds no rows; [`examples/clients`](https://github.com/getbintana/bintana/tree/main/examples/clients) is the other direction, a button that writes
what its list shows as a workbook.

## Bytes

A file's contents, when they are not text. This is what a `File.Load` cannot
carry: a PNG, a PDF, a thumbnail in a record, anything read to be written back
out unchanged.

```js
const b = File.LoadBytes("logo.png");
b.Length                                  // 763
b.Slice(0, 8).ToHex()                     // "89504e470d0a1a0a" — the signature
File.SaveBytes("copy.png", b);
Hash.Sha256(b)                            // the file's digest
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `new Bytes([value])` | nothing (empty), text (its **UTF-8**), a list of numbers `0`–`255`, or another `Bytes` (a copy) |
| `Bytes.FromBase64(text)`, `Bytes.FromHex(text)` | refused, not guessed, when the text is not that |
| `Length` (ro) | how many bytes |
| `At(index)` | one byte as a number, `0`–`255`. **Throws** past the end rather than answering `undefined` |
| `Slice(from, [count])` | a new `Bytes`; **clamped** like a string's, and a negative `from` counts from the end |
| `Concat(other, …)` | a new one, end to end |
| `Equals(other)` | byte for byte. `==` compares two objects by identity, so **this is the only comparison there is** |
| `ToText()` | the text it is, or a **throw** when it is not valid UTF-8 — never the replacement character, which is a corruption that travels |
| `ToBase64()`, `ToHex()` | as text; hex is lower-case, the way a digest is written |
| `toString()` | `"Bytes(763)"` — a description, **not** the content |
| `toJSON()` | base64, so a record carrying a file survives `File.SaveJson` |

**It cannot be changed.** There is no `Set`, no resize, no writing into it: every
operation answers a new `Bytes`. That is what makes it safe to hand one to a
record, keep it, and hand it to somebody else — a string's bargain, and the
reason a thumbnail in a `Record` cannot change under the record's feet.

**Text and bytes convert explicitly, in both directions.** `new Bytes(text)`
encodes UTF-8, `ToText()` decodes it and refuses what is not valid UTF-8 rather
than answering the replacement character. And `${b}` is deliberately
`Bytes(763)`: a JPEG interpolated into a log line by accident is a megabyte of
noise that reads as if it had worked.

`ArrayBuffer` and the typed arrays stay off the language — see
[language.md](https://github.com/getbintana/bintana-llm/blob/main/docs/llm/language.md). This is one class with the operations an application
performs on a file, and no view/buffer distinction to learn.

## Decimal

Exact base-10 arithmetic, **with the ordinary operators**. This is what money is.

```js
const price = new Decimal("19.99");
const total = price * qty + tax;             // exact, to the cent
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `new Decimal(value, [decimals])` | from text, a number or another decimal; `decimals` fixes the scale |
| `Round(decimals, [how])` | `"Away"` (the default — the half goes away from zero, which is what an invoice does), `"Even"` (banker's), `"Zero"`, `"Up"`, `"Down"` |
| `Trim()` | drops trailing zeros: `2.50` → `2.5` |
| `Abs()`, `Scale`, `Sign`, `IsExact` | |
| `Number()` | the nearest double, asked for **by name**: for a chart, a width, a percentage — anywhere the value stops being money |
| `Decimal.Split(total, parts)` | pieces that add back up to the total, **exactly** |
| `toString()`, `toJSON()` | its own text. Which is why `${d}` and `JSON.stringify(d)` are both exact, and why a decimal in a file reads back as itself |

`+ - * /`, `< > <= >=` and unary `-` all work, and mix with ordinary numbers and
strings: `price * 3`, `price - "0.99"`.

Construct from **text**, not from a literal: `0.1` and `1.005` are already the
wrong number before anything can round them. `JSON.stringify` writes a decimal's
text, because a JSON number would be a double again.

## Day

The calendar date, which is the value JavaScript does not have. **A date is the
text `"YYYY-MM-DD"`** — what a [`DatePicker`](controls.md#datepicker) answers
with, what a `Field.Date` holds, what goes into JSON as itself, and what `a < b`
already orders.

| | |
|---|---|
| `Today` | today's date as `"YYYY-MM-DD"`, at **local** midnight |
| `Add(date, days)` | the date `days` later. `days` may be negative, and it **refuses to leave the calendar** rather than answering something impossible |
| `Between(from, to)` | whole days from one to the other, signed |
| `Weekday(date)` | `"Monday"` … `"Sunday"` — **a key to test against, never text to show** |

Never borrow a `Date` for this. `new Date("2026-03-08").getDate()` is 7 in
Buenos Aires and 8 in Berlin; `new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)` is
yesterday, all morning, in Lima.

## Text

What a string measures, asked where there is no [`Painter`](controls.md#painter)
— which is everywhere a layout is *decided* rather than drawn.

```js
Text.Width("Statement of account", "Bold 18")        // 178
Text.Size(description, "", { Width: 300 })           // { Width, Height, Lines }
Text.Lines(description, "", { Width: 300 })          // the lines it breaks into
Text.Size(markup, "", { Width: 300, Markup: true })   // a paragraph with bold in it
Text.Escape("a < b & c")                             // "a &lt; b &amp; c"
Text.IndexAt(paragraph, 40, 12, "", { Width: 300 })   // 37 -- the character there
Text.Bounds(paragraph, 10, 37, "", { Width: 300 })    // [{ X, Y, Width, Height }, …]
Text.Font                                            // "Cantarell 11"
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Width(text, [font], [options])` | how wide it lays out, in pixels |
| `Height(text, [font], [options])` | how tall — one line's height, or the whole block's when it wraps |
| `Size(text, [font], [options])` | `{ Width, Height, Lines }` in **one** measurement, which is one layout instead of three |
| `Lines(text, [font], [options])` | the lines it breaks into, as an array — for a caller that will draw them one by one. **Refused with `Markup`** — see below |
| `Escape(text)` | the text as markup that says exactly it: `&`, `<` and `>` escaped |
| `IndexAt(text, x, y, [font], [options])` | which character is at that point, as an index into the text **as it was laid out** — a markup run's tags already consumed. Above the text is `0` and below it is the end |
| `Bounds(text, from, to, [font], [options])` | the rectangles covering those characters: `{ X, Y, Width, Height }`, one per line the range crosses and more than one on a line that changes direction |
| `LineOf(text, index)` | the line an index falls on, 1-based and clamped — `index` is the number a **search** gave, so it is counted in UTF-16 units |
| `OffsetAt(text, line, [column])` | the **character** offset of that line and column, clamped the way an editor's `Select` clamps |
| `Font` (ro) | the desktop's UI font, which is what a control draws with unless CSS says otherwise. Where there is no desktop to ask — a `main` project — GTK's own default, `"Sans 10"`, which is what `Drawing` draws in |

`font` is a Pango description (`"Cantarell Bold 10"`); `""` or nothing means
`Text.Font`. `options` is `{ Width, Markup, Align }`, the same three
[`Painter`](controls.md#painter) draws with: `Width` wraps to that many pixels,
which is what makes `Height` and `Lines` interesting; `Markup` says the string is
Pango markup; `Align` is what wrapped lines are aligned to inside `Width` and
means nothing to a measurement. A word wider than the box is **broken** rather
than left to overflow, so the measurement never promises a width the text will
not keep.

**`IndexAt` and `Bounds` are the two questions a selection asks**, and neither
can be answered by a caller: where the lines broke, which run is in which font
and which way the text runs are all the layout's, and none of it survives being
handed back as strings. They are a pair — a pointer becomes an offset, and an
offset becomes the rectangles to paint behind the words — and the offsets are
**JS string indices**, so `plain.slice(from, to)` is the text and a document with
an emoji in it still slices where it was clicked. Pass the same `font` and
`options` the text was measured and drawn with, or the answer is about a layout
nobody can see. `lib/markdown` selects with these two and nothing else.

**`LineOf` and `OffsetAt` are the same pair an [`Editor`](controls.md#editor--inherited-by-both-editors)
has**, for a string with no control around it — what the IDE's own scanners use
to turn a match into a line. They are deliberately **not one unit**: `LineOf`
receives what a search returned (a UTF-16 index, where an emoji is two), and
`OffsetAt` receives a column in characters (where it is one), which is what
`Column` and `Select` count. `OffsetAt(editor.Line, editor.Column)` is exactly
the cursor's `Offset`, and `LineOf(m.Index)` is exactly the line the match was
on. **The lines are the editor's and not this layout's**: `\n`, `\r\n` as one, a
lone `\r` and U+2029 break, U+2028 does not — so `Text.Lines` and `LineOf` can
disagree on that one character, and the one a `GotoLine` lands on is `LineOf`'s.

**`Markup` is for the paragraph whose font changes halfway** — a bold word, a
name in italic, a code span. `Text.Lines` refuses it, and that is not a gap: the
lines of a styled paragraph are runs and not strings, so drawing them one by one
would draw a paragraph that had lost its bold. Measure it here and draw it with
`Painter.Text(markup, x, y, { Width, Markup: true })`, which is one layout for
both. Markup that does not parse **throws where it was written**, rather than
laying out nothing and warning on the console; `Escape` is how the `<` a document
actually contains gets in. `lib/markdown` is the library this was added for.

**The numbers are the ones a `Painter` gives**: the same fonts and the same
desktop resolution, so `Text.Width(s, f)` equals `p.TextWidth(s)` with
`p.Font = f`. `tests/widgets` asserts that rather than trusting it. Two caveats
worth knowing: a **vector** surface (`SavePdf`) can differ by a pixel, because
hinting is off there; and a drawing whose font an `app.css` changed is measured
here in the desktop's, not in that one — pass the font you set.

**Measure with the same call you will draw with.** A band that grows to fit its
text and the lines that land in it come from `Text.Size` and `Text.Lines` in
`lib/report`, and that is not tidiness: two different ways of breaking the same
string agree until the day they do not, and then the text is a line taller than
the box that was measured for it.

Before this existed the only measurement in the runtime was on a painter, and a
painter is valid only inside the `Draw` it came from — so nothing could size
itself to its own words before drawing them, and a band's height had to be
declared and hoped for.

**And what is measured here with no display is drawn with no display by
[`Drawing`](#drawing)**, whose painter takes the same font at the same
resolution — which is how `ReportDocument` writes a PDF from a `main` project.

## Screen

How big the desktop is, and how many pieces it is in.

```js
Screen.Width                    // the monitor the window is on, in pixels
Screen.Height
Screen.Scale                    // 2 on a HiDPI panel
Screen.Monitors()               // [{ X, Y, Width, Height, Scale, Name }, …]
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Width`, `Height` (ro) | the monitor the application's active window is on; the first one the display lists before any window is shown, and `0` with no display at all |
| `Scale` (ro) | that monitor's scale factor, `1` unless the panel is HiDPI |
| `Monitors()` (ro) | every monitor: `X`/`Y` are where it sits in the desktop's coordinates, `Width`/`Height`/`Scale` are its own, and `Name` is the connector — `"HDMI-1"`, `"eDP-1"` — **a key to remember a choice by, not prose to show** |

**The numbers are the same pixels a form's `Width` is** — logical ones, with the
scale answered separately — so `Screen.Width / 2` is a window width and not a
surprise on a HiDPI panel.

**There is no primary monitor and no work area, and both are GTK4 rather than a
choice.** GTK4 dropped `primary` because Wayland does not answer it, and dropped
the work area for the same reason: how much of the screen a panel or a dock has
taken is not something a client can ask. So `Width` means *where the user is
looking* — the monitor the active window is on — and a window meant to fill the
screen should be `Maximized`, which is a request the compositor honours, rather
than a size worked out from these numbers.

**Knowing the geometry is not being able to place a window.** `Form.Center()` is
already a no-op on Wayland: the compositor decides where windows go. These
numbers are for deciding *sizes* and *layouts* — a form that opens narrower on a
laptop, a drawing sized to the panel it will be shown on — and for remembering
which monitor a user had something on, by `Name`, so the *next* thing you ask for
matches.

## Time

The clock half of [`Day`](#day), and the same bargain: **a time of day is the
text `"HH:MM"`** — or `"HH:MM:SS"` — and nothing else.

| | |
|---|---|
| `Now` | the time of day now, with seconds (`"21:03:58"`) |
| `Add(time, minutes)` | `minutes` may be negative, and it **wraps at midnight**, because a time of day has no day to fall off |
| `Between(from, to)` | whole minutes from one to the other, signed |
| `Seconds(time)` | seconds since midnight — the exact number, for anything finer than a minute |

```js
Time.Add("08:30", 40)              // "09:10"
Time.Add("23:50", 30)              // "00:20"
Time.Between("08:30", "19:00")     // 630
"09:30" < "17:00"                  // true, already
```

**It is not a `Date` with the date thrown away.** An instant carries a day and a
time zone; 08:30 has neither — a shop opens at half past eight in the shop's own
zone, on every day it is open. Borrowing an instant to stand for it is the bug
`Day` exists to prevent, one unit down.

**Seconds are optional and are kept when they are there.** `"08:30"` stays five
characters through `Add`; `"08:30:15"` keeps its seconds. `Now` always has them,
because the time *now* is a measurement and `.slice(0, 5)` is how a caller throws
away what it does not want — the other way round is not available.

The shape is strict: `"8:30"` is refused rather than guessed at, and so is
`"24:00"`, which is a duration of a day and not a time any clock shows. That
strictness is what makes `a < b` order two of them, which is the whole reason for
holding a time as text.

## Regex

A pattern, with nothing remembered between questions.

```js
const pair = new Regex("(?<key>\\w+)\\s*=\\s*(\\d+)");

pair.IsMatch(text)
const m = pair.Match(text);           // the first, or null
m.Value; m.Index; m.Length; m.Group("key"); m.Group(1); m.Groups[0]
for (const m of pair.Matches(text)) …
pair.Replace(text, "${key}")          // .NET substitution: $1, ${name}, $&, $$
pair.Split(text)
Regex.Escape(name)                    // a name as a literal inside a pattern
```

Options: `IgnoreCase`, `Multiline`, `Singleline`, `Unicode`,
`IgnorePatternWhitespace`. `Replace` replaces **all** unless a `count` says how
many. There is no `lastIndex`, so a `Regex` can be a `const`. A replacement
function is handed the `Match`.

**`Regex` is the only way to a pattern built from a string**: the name `RegExp`
is not in the language any more, and `Unicode` is where the `u` went — without
it `\p{L}` compiles and matches the literal text `p{L}`. A fixed pattern is still
well written as a literal (`/x/g` is syntax and needs no global); see
[language.md](https://github.com/getbintana/bintana-llm/blob/main/docs/llm/language.md#what-is-not-installed).

**And what a person types into a find bar is a different engine.** An editor's
`Search(text, { Regex: true })` is GtkSourceView's own, which is PCRE2 (GRegex):
**always multiline**, `\d`/`\w`/`\b` **Unicode-aware**, `$` also matching before
a final newline, and PCRE2 grammar (`\p{L}`, `\K`, atomic groups) available. So
the same pattern can mean two things in one application — `Regex("^a")` is one
line, the find bar's is every line — and a search box and a lint meant to agree
should write it the language's way: `{ Unicode: true }` for `\p{L}`,
`{ Multiline: true }` when every line is wanted. The editor's side is in
[`SourceEditor`](controls.md#sourceeditor).

`Regex.Escape` is the one that is easy to forget: any pattern built around a
name the program did not choose needs it.

## Logger

`Logger.Debug`, `Info`, `Warning`, `Error` — arguments joined with a space, like
`print`. Plus `Level`, `Target` (`"Terminal"`, `"Journal"`, or a file path to
append to) and `Handler`. This is what `console` used to be.

## Clipboard

`Clipboard.Copy(text)` is immediate. `Clipboard.Paste(cb)` takes a callback —
the clipboard belongs to whoever owns the selection, so its contents arrive when
that application answers. `""` when there is nothing to paste, not an error.

`Clipboard.CopyImage(bytes)` and `Clipboard.PasteImage(cb)` are the same pair
for a picture. `bytes` is an image GDK decodes from the bytes themselves — what
`QrView.ToPng()` and `DrawingArea.ToPng()` answer with — and the callback gets
a PNG as `Bytes`, or `null` when the clipboard holds no image. It is `Bytes` and
not a control because it is a value: `Picture.LoadBytes` reads the same one.

## Record and Field

The shape data has, declared once — what a control's properties are to a
control. Use one instead of a bag of keys nobody checks.

```js
class Customer extends Record {
    static Naming = "same";                     // same | lower | snake
    static Fields = {
        Name:     Field.Text({ required: true, max: 80 }),
        Email:    Field.Text({ as: "email_address" }),
        Balance:  Field.Decimal({ decimals: 2, min: 0 }),
        Category: Field.Enum(["Retail", "Wholesale"]),
        Active:   Field.Bool(true),
        Since:    Field.Date(),
        Tags:     Field.List(Field.Text()),
    };

    /* A field written by hand is a field. Read-only, so it is not written back. */
    get Label() { return `${this.Name} (${this.Email})`; }
}
```

| Kind | Holds | Options beyond `as` and `def` |
|---|---|---|
| `Field.Text(o)` | a string | `required`, `max` (characters) |
| `Field.Int(o)` | a whole number | `required`, `min`, `max` |
| `Field.Number(o)` | a number | `required`, `min`, `max`, `decimals` |
| `Field.Bool(def, o)` | `true`/`false`, and SQL's `0`/`1` | |
| `Field.Date(o)` | `"YYYY-MM-DD"`, checked against the calendar | `required` |
| `Field.Time(o)` | `"HH:MM"` or `"HH:MM:SS"` | `required`, `min`, `max` (compared as text, which is what the fixed shape is for) |
| `Field.DateTime(o)` | `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM"` or `"...:SS"` — a date and a time — with `Z` or `+HH:MM` when the moment has a zone, kept as written | `required`; `min`/`max` over local time only |
| `Field.Bytes(o)` | a [`Bytes`](../reference/globals/Bytes.md) — a file in a record | `required`, `max` (bytes) |
| `Field.Enum(values, def, o)` | one of `values`, starting at `def` | `required` |
| `Field.List(item, o)` | an array, each entry through `item` — a `Field` or a `Record` class | `required`, `max` |
| `Field.Record(of, o)` | another record: the class, or `() => the class` for a shape that contains itself | `required` |
| `Field.Decimal(o)` | a [`Decimal`](../reference/globals/Decimal.md) at a fixed scale | `required`, `min`, `max`, `decimals` (2 by default) |

| On a record | |
|---|---|
| `new C({ Name: "Ana" })` | through the setters, so every value is checked |
| `Apply(values)` | assigns each property of a plain object to the field of the same name, through the fields' own checks |
| `Serialize([all])` | a plain object — **what differs from the start**, or everything with `true` |
| `toJSON()` | so `JSON.stringify` and `File.SaveJson` are the record |
| `Clone()` | a copy, which is what a dialog edits so that Cancel costs nothing |
| `Validate()` | what is wrong with what the record holds **now** — a different question, and the one a form asks before saving |
| `Problems` (ro) | **the report of one `Load`**: what the file said that could not be taken |
| `PropertyNames()`, `PropertyOptions(name)`, `Dump()` | as a widget answers them |
| `PropertyInfo(name)` | `{ Kind, Column, Key }`: what a field *is*, for whoever maps it onto something else |
| `C.Load(json)` | a file, read **leniently** |
| `C.LoadXml(node)` | the same, from an XML document or element — see [a record over XML](#a-record-over-xml) |
| `ToXml([all])` | a new element: what differs from the start, or every field |
| `SaveXml(node)` | writes into that element, touching **only** what the shape models |

```js
const c = new Customer({ Name: "Ana" });
c.Balance = 10.567;                 // 10.57: rounded to what it holds
c.Category = "Other";               // throws, naming the two it accepts
File.SaveJson(path, c);

const read = Customer.Load(File.LoadJson(path));
if (read.Problems.length) Message.Warning("{0} problems in the file", read.Problems.length);
```

- **Assigning validates and throws; `Load` does not stop.** A row that no longer
  satisfies today's rules must still be readable or it can never be corrected —
  so a value `Load` cannot take leaves the field at its starting value and goes
  on `Problems`.
- **A key the record does not describe survives the round trip**, so an older
  program cannot delete a newer one's field by saving the file.
- **Money is `Field.Decimal({ decimals: 2 })`.** There is no `Money`. It
  serialises as text, because a JSON number would be a double again.
- `Naming` says how the *file* spells its keys, once; `as` is the exception for
  the field the rule does not fit.
- A wrong declaration is answered the first time the class is used.

### A record over XML

XML is a **document** and not a value, so this is a declaration rather than a
conversion: `static Xml` names the element, and the fields name their own with
the `as`/`Naming` pair a column already uses. Three options cover what a plain
object has nowhere to keep — `attribute` for a value kept as one, `in` for the
wrapper a list lives under, and `element` for the item name of a list of values.

```js
class Task extends Record {
    static Xml = { Root: "Task" };
    static Fields = {
        UID:       Field.Int({ key: true }),               // the identity, for SaveXml
        Name:      Field.Text(),
        Start:     Field.DateTime(),
        Milestone: Field.Bool(),                           // written true/false; 0/1 read
        Links:     Field.List(Link),                       // <PredecessorLink> repeated
    };
}

class Project extends Record {
    static Xml = { Root: "Project",
                   Namespace: ["http://schemas.microsoft.com/project",
                               "http://schemas.microsoft.com/project/2007"] };
    static Fields = {
        Author: Field.Text({ attribute: true }),           // Author="…", not an element
        Tasks:  Field.List(Task, { in: "Tasks" }),         // <Tasks><Task>…</Task></Tasks>
        Tags:   Field.List(Field.Text(), { element: "Tag", in: "Tags" }),
    };
}

const p = Project.LoadXml(File.LoadXml("plan.xml"));      // lenient; Problems
p.Tasks[0].Name = "Analyse";
File.SaveXml("plan.xml", p.SaveXml(doc.Root));            // in place: only what it models
const fresh = p.ToXml(true);                              // a new element, every field
```

- **`ToXml` is `Serialize`, `LoadXml` is `Load`.** `ToXml()` omits what is at
  its starting value exactly as `Serialize` does — **a `key` excepted, which is
  identity and is written either way** — and `ToXml(true)` writes every field,
  which is what a schema whose elements are not `minOccurs="0"` needs.
- **`SaveXml` is the lossless road.** It writes into the element it is handed
  and touches only what the shape models: unknown elements, foreign namespaces
  and comments stay exactly where they were, and a list is reconciled — an item
  is matched by the record's `key` — key text for key text, a key at its start
  included, because `<UID>0</UID>` is a UID and there is no INSERT here to
  assign one — or by position, unmatched elements are removed, new ones are
  added, and the order of the array is the order of the elements afterwards.
- **A `key` is written whatever it holds, by both verbs** — `ToXml()` writes it
  and `SaveXml` writes it where any other field back at its starting value has
  its element removed — so the project summary task keeps its `UID 0`, and the
  unmodelled children of the element it matched stay with it. `Table`'s *an int
  key of 0 is a row never saved* (`Save` inserts) is the database's rule and
  does not reach XML.
- **`namespace` is a string or a list**: the first is written, all are accepted
  on read, and a root in neither is a `Problems` line rather than a refusal.
  An official schema and the files it describes can disagree about the URI and
  both be right — MSPDI does.
- **What the shape does not model is reported, never silently written.**
  `LoadXml` puts an unknown element or attribute in `Problems` (with the path,
  for a child); `ToXml` does not write it; `SaveXml` does not see it.
- **`LoadXml` matches by local name** — `Find`/`FindAll` are how it reads — and
  a name that cannot be an element is refused where it is written, by the DOM.
- `Field.Bool` writes `true`/`false` and reads `true`/`false`/`1`/`0`; a number
  is read with a dot and never the desktop's comma.

### A record inside a record

Master–detail is **declared**, not assembled: a `Record` class is accepted
wherever a field is expected.

```js
class Quote extends Record {
    static Fields = {
        Customer: Field.Text({ required: true }),
        Lines:    Field.List(Line),               // write this, not Field.List(Field.Record(Line))
        Ship:     Field.Record(Address),          // starts at null
        Bill:     Field.Record(Address, { def: { City: "CABA" } }),
    };
}

const q = Quote.Load(File.LoadJson(path));        // lenient all the way down
q.Lines.push(new Line({ What: "Chapa", Price: "16500" }));
q.Ship = { Street: "Corrientes 1234" };           // one line, through the child's setters
q.Validate();     // ["Lines[2].Price: 0 at least, got -5", "Ship.City: 20 characters at most"]
File.SaveJson(path, q);                           // one object
```

- **A record field starts at `null` — absent, not empty**, which is what a file
  means by a key it does not have and what lets a shape contain itself. `def` is
  how a record that always has one says so: `{ def: {} }` empty, `{ def: { … } }`
  seeded. Never on a shape that contains itself.
- **A shape that contains itself needs a thunk**: inside a class body the class is
  not bound yet, so write `Children: Field.List(() => Node)`. `static get
  Fields()` is refused — it used to declare no fields at all, silently.
- **Naming a class in `static Fields` is a load-order dependency**, because the
  static field runs at declaration: `Lines: Field.List(Line)` needs `Line`'s file
  ahead of it in `project.json`'s `sources`, the same way `extends` does, or it is
  `ReferenceError: Line is not defined` at the declaration. The thunk removes the
  dependency (`Field.List(() => Line)`) — but writing the order down is better
  than deferring it.
- `Serialize` writes one object, each child in **its own** `Naming` and keeping
  its own unknown keys. `Clone` is deep. `Validate` and `Problems` answer for the
  whole tree at once, with the path in front of each complaint, by **property**
  name.
- **A null entry in a list of records is refused** — a list has fewer entries, not
  absent ones — where a null in a `Field.List(Field.Text())` becomes `""`.
- `push` goes around the setter, as it always has: a plain object pushed into a
  list of records is answered by `Validate` (`Lines[1] is not a Line`), not when
  it goes in. Push a constructed record.
- A record that really holds itself cannot be serialised: JSON cannot say it, so
  it is refused with `<Class> contains itself`.

## Database and Table

A record over a table. `Database.Sqlite` is a **driver** in C; `Table` is the
portable half in `rad.js`.

```js
class Client extends Record {
    static Naming = "snake";                      // the SQL spelling, once
    static Fields = {
        Id:         Field.Int({ key: true }),     // the identity
        Name:       Field.Text({ required: true, max: 80 }),
        Balance:    Field.Decimal({ decimals: 2 }),
        PostalCode: Field.Text({ max: 8 }),       // column postal_code
    };
}

const db      = Database.Sqlite("data/sales.db");   // ":memory:" also works
const clients = db.Table("clients", Client);

const c = clients.Save(new Client({ Name: "Ana" }));  // INSERT; fills c.Id
c.Balance = "1500.50";
clients.Save(c);                                      // UPDATE, by the key
```

| On a table | |
|---|---|
| `Find(...key)` | one record or `null`; one value per key field, in declaration order |
| `All()` | every row, as records |
| `Where(sql, ...params)` | the filter is **SQL**; anything after it (`ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`) goes too |
| `Count([sql], ...params)` | a number, building no records |
| `Save(rec)` | `Insert` when the key is at its starting value, else `Update` |
| `Insert(rec)` | INSERT, and tells the record its new key |
| `Update(rec)` | UPDATE by key; **throws** when it matched no row |
| `Delete(rec)` | DELETE by key; throws when it matched no row |
| `Name`, `Shape`, `Connection` (ro) | |

| On a connection | |
|---|---|
| `Query(sql, [params])` | the rows a statement answers, as **plain objects** — for the report, the `GROUP BY`, the join that is not one shape |
| `Execute(sql, [params])` | **one** statement, answering `{ Changes, LastId }` |
| `Script(sql)` | several statements and **no parameters**: a schema, a migration |
| `Transaction(fn)` | everything in `fn` or nothing. **Nests**, through savepoints, so a function that wraps its own work in one is safe to call from inside another |
| `Columns(table)` | `[{ Name, Type, Required, Key }]` — what is really in the table, which is how a program checks that a record's shape still fits |
| `Tables` (ro) | the tables and views, ordered |
| `Dialect` (ro) | `{ Placeholder, Quote, NewKey }` — **what differs per engine**, so the portable half above can build SQL without knowing which engine it is talking to |
| `Path`, `Open` (ro), `Close()` | this driver's own |

- **All five of sqlite's storage classes**: TEXT (`Field.Text`, `Enum`, `Date`,
  `Time`, `Decimal`), INTEGER (`Int`, `Bool`), REAL (`Number`), BLOB
  (`Field.Bytes`) and NULL. `Field.Record`/`Field.List` are still refused: a
  detail is its own table.
- **Values are bound, never interpolated.** There is no way to ask for anything
  else. Write `Where("name = ?", typed)`, never string concatenation.
- **A row is a file.** `Load` reads a row and `Serialize` writes one, so nothing
  converts values: a `Decimal` is stored as **text** (exact — a REAL would lose
  the cent), a boolean as sqlite's `0`/`1`, a date as `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.
- **A column the shape does not describe survives the round trip**, so saving a
  row does not empty a column this record says nothing about.
- **Reading is lenient**: a value today's rules refuse goes on `Problems` and
  costs that column only. Check `rec.Problems` right after a `Find` or a `Load`.
- **`Validate()` is the state; `Problems` is the report of one load.** Use
  `Validate()` for a Save button and for marking a field — `Problems` never
  clears, so validating with it refuses to save a record the user already fixed.
  Use `Problems` once, on opening, to say what the file lost. Want both? Say
  `rec.Problems.concat(rec.Validate())`.
- **`key: true` is on the shape, not the source.** An `int` key at 0 is a row
  never saved, which is how `Save` decides. A key the *program* chooses is never
  at 0 once filled, so `Save` would try to update a row that is not there — use
  `Insert` for that one.
- **The shape is checked against the table** on the first statement: a nested
  field, a missing column, a table that is not there, and a column spelled with
  another case — that last because SQL identifiers are case-insensitive, so
  `Code` against `code` would write perfectly and read *empty*.
- `Naming` must match the columns. `snake` for `CustomerName` → `customer_name`;
  `as: "..."` for the one field the rule does not fit.
- **Write `balance TEXT` for a decimal column.** Never
  `NUMERIC`/`DECIMAL(12,2)`/`INTEGER`: those are *affinities* and sqlite turns
  `'19.90'` into the double `19.9`, losing the scale and the exactness. `Table`
  refuses a decimal field over any column whose affinity is not TEXT.
- **sqlite cannot then order or total that column, and that is sqlite's
  limitation — do it in the program.** `ORDER BY balance` compares bytes
  (`'9.00'` after `'10.00'`) and `SUM(balance)` goes through a double. Load the
  rows and use `Decimal`'s own operators:
  `rows.sort((a, b) => a.Balance - b.Balance < 0 ? -1 : 1)` and
  `total = total + r.Balance`. This is the same thing text ordering needs
  anyway — see `Locale.Compare` below.
- **If an application's core is money, say so: sqlite may be the wrong engine.**
  A driver over one with a real `NUMERIC` maps the same field to a numeric column
  and every one of those statements works.
- **To order or filter a decimal in SQL, name the collation *in the statement*.**
  That works and keeps the file portable, because the schema stays plain `TEXT`:
  `ORDER BY money COLLATE DECIMAL`, `WHERE money > ? COLLATE DECIMAL`,
  `MIN(money COLLATE DECIMAL)`, and `decimal_sum(money)` for an exact total (a
  window function, so `OVER (ORDER BY id)` is a running total). Through a
  `Table`: `table.Where("money > ? COLLATE DECIMAL", "9.00")`.
- **What breaks compatibility is `COLLATE DECIMAL` in a `CREATE TABLE`**, not in
  a statement: every other client then fails with `no such collation sequence` on
  any `ORDER BY`, `MIN`, `MAX`, comparison or `CREATE INDEX` for that column.
  Never generate it; if a user asks for it, warn them in the same breath. The one
  thing per-statement collation cannot give is a useful index on that column.
- **A raw `Execute` binding a `Decimal` writes its exact text**, which is right
  for a TEXT column and becomes a double in a numeric one. A `Table` is the
  safe path.
- **Not built**: a detail saved with its master (a `Field.List` is refused), a
  cursor for a grid, and a `.conn` project resource. If one of those blocks the
  application you were asked for, that is an [ISSUE](https://github.com/getbintana/bintana/blob/main/docs/llm/issues.md).
- No lazy loading, no identity map, no session. A detail is loaded with its
  master or not at all.
- sqlite is optional at build time; without it `Database.Sqlite` says which
  package is missing.

## Http

A native HTTP client over libsoup3. `Http.Client(opts)` holds its own session;
`Http.Get/Post/...` are shorthands on a shared default client.

```js
const c = Http.Client({ BaseUrl: "https://api.example.com/v1", Timeout: 60000 });
c.Get("/users", {}, (r) => print(r.Body.ToText()), (e) => print(e.Message));
const r = Http.GetWait("https://example.com/", { Timeout: 5000 });
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Client([opts])` | a client with its own session: `BaseUrl`, `Headers`, `Timeout` (ms, `0` waits forever), `FollowRedirects` (default `true`), `Language`, `UserAgent`, `Proxy`, `Auth`, `Cookies`, `IdleTimeout`, `MaxConns`, `MaxPerHost`. The options are an object — a bare URL is refused |
| `IdleTimeout` | ms a pooled connection idles before soup closes it (`0` is soup's own 60 s); soup counts seconds, so anything under one becomes one |
| `MaxConns`, `MaxPerHost` | constructor-only (`10`/`2` unless told): soup takes them once, so assigning later throws |
| `Request(method, url, [body], [opts], onDone, [onError])` | any verb: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`; anything else is refused, in the blocking spelling too |
| `Auth` | `{ User, Password }`, Basic and preemptive; reads back `null` when none is set. An explicit `Authorization` header wins over it, and an explicit `Content-Type` header wins over the one the body's shape implies |
| `Get(url, [opts], onDone, [onError])` | the ordinary read |
| `Post(url, body, [opts], onDone, [onError])` | `body` is text, [`Bytes`](../reference/globals/Bytes.md), an object (canonical JSON, `application/json`) or a [`Multipart`](../reference/globals/Http.md#uploads) |
| `Put(url, body, [opts], onDone, [onError])`, `Patch(…)` | with body, like `Post` |
| `Delete(url, [opts], onDone, [onError])`, `Head(…)` | no body, like `Get` |
| `Stream(method, url, [body], [opts], onLine, [onDone], [onError])` | the answer **as it arrives**: `onLine(line, handle)` once per text line, the newline stripped, blank lines included. Method-first like `Request`, so a `POST` whose answer comes in pieces needs no second name |
| `RequestWait(method, url, [body], [opts])` | the blocking spelling: answers with the record, **throws** on transport failure — and what it throws carries the same `Kind` and `Status` the callback would have been handed |
| `GetWait(url, [opts])`, `PostWait(url, body, [opts])` | same, per verb |
| `PutWait(url, body, [opts])`, `PatchWait(…)` | same, with body |
| `DeleteWait(url, [opts])`, `HeadWait(…)` | same, no body |
| `UserAgent` | sent as-is; `""` sends none — and some servers answer the nameless with an error |
| `Log` | `"none"` unless told: `"minimal"`, `"headers"` or `"body"` sends the traffic through `Logger` at `Debug` — so `Logger.Level = "Debug"` shows it and a `Handler` takes it; a `Wait`'s never reaches a `Handler`, since its context is private and its caller is blocked |
| `Cookies` | `false` unless told: `true` keeps a jar of the session's own, so a login answers the next request |
| `Tls` | `{ Ca, Cert }`, or nothing. `Ca` is a **certificate to verify the server's against** — the company's own CA on an internal network, or the server's own file when it is self-signed, which is exactly the case the system store cannot reach and a per-program file can. `Cert` is **the server's certificate, pinned**: it must be byte for byte that one. Either accepts; `null` when none is set. Both files are read where they are assigned, so a wrong path is a mistake on the next line rather than on the first internal request. **The system's store is still trusted**, and a server it already accepts never reaches the check at all — this is a second opinion, not a replacement |
| `new Multipart()` | a file upload as a value: `Field(name, value)` and `File(name, filename, body, [contentType])` (body is text or `Bytes`, `application/octet-stream` unless told), both answering the upload for chaining; `Length` counts the parts. Sent as the body of a `Post`/`Put`/`Patch`, which sets its own `Content-Type` with soup's boundary — an explicit one beside it is refused |
| `Part(index)` | one part read back: `{ Name, Filename, Type, Data }`, `Data` as `Bytes`. Past the end is refused |
| `Server([opts])` | a listener of its own, for a static file server, a local API, a callback endpoint. Everything about it is on [`HttpServer`](../reference/globals/HttpServer.md) |

`onDone({ Status, Reason, Headers, Body, Url })` — `4xx/5xx` come here, it is an
answer. `Headers` keys are lower-cased. `Body` is always `Bytes` (`ToText()` is
strict UTF-8). `onError({ Message, Kind, Status })` — `Kind` is one of
`Timeout`, `Dns`, `Tls`, `Refused`, `Cancelled`, `Redirect`, `Error`.
Both callbacks are handed the request's own **handle as a second argument**,
so a form with more than one request in the air can tell whose answer arrived:
`Stop()` asks rather than undoes, and a cancelled request still answers a turn
later. The handle answers `Running`, `TimedOut`, `Url`, `Method` and `Stop()`
(cancelling calls `onError` with `Kind: "Cancelled"`). Per-request `opts` carry
`Headers`, `Query: {k:v}` (appended escaped), `Body`, `ContentType`, `Timeout`,
`FollowRedirects`, `Auth` — and naming any of them is what makes an object
options rather than a JSON body. A repeated response header keeps the last of
them, `Set-Cookie` included, which is what `Cookies: true` is for. A `Query`
value of `undefined` or `null` is not sent, and a header or query value that
cannot become text is refused by the call — not skipped with the conversion's
error left pending.

**`Tls` is for a server the system's store does not trust** — an internal one
signed by the company's own CA, or a self-signed device — and it is a client
option (`Http.Client({ Tls: { Ca: "certs/company-ca.pem" } })`) and a property,
never a per-request one. `Ca` is a certificate the server's chain must reach,
**with the host name checked against what was dialled**; `Cert` pins the server's
own certificate, byte for byte. Either may be given, or both, and either accepts.
Both files are read where they are assigned, so a wrong path throws on that line.
It only ever *widens* trust by a file the program named: a server the store
already accepts never reaches the check, and there is no accept-anything spelling.
**A client with a `Tls` resumes no TLS session** — a resumed handshake presents
no certificate, so nothing would be verified, and a server one client accepted
would then be reachable by every other client in the process. A refused handshake
is `onError` with `Kind: "Tls"`.

**`Stream` reads before EOF**, which is the difference: the other verbs answer
once, when the response is complete, and a feed that never completes is
therefore never read at all.

```js
this.feed = Http.Stream("GET", `${addr}/event`, { Timeout: 0 },
    (line) => { if (line.startsWith("data: ")) this.event(JSON.parse(line.slice(6))); },
    (res)  => this.ended(res),
    (err)  => this.failed(err));
this.feed.Stop();      // and the onError still arrives, a turn later
```

Five things it promises. The **end** is the usual `onDone`, with the usual
record — and an **empty `Body`**, since what already went out line by line is
not sent twice. Only a **2xx streams**: a `4xx`/`5xx` is an answer, so it
arrives whole in `onDone` with `onLine` never called, and a line arriving at
all therefore means the status was 2xx. `Timeout` is still the deadline for
the **whole flight** and not the gap between lines, so a feed meant to stay
open asks with `Timeout: 0` — but what arrived before a deadline or a `Stop()`
stays arrived, which is the part the buffered verbs cannot do. `Stop()` is
safe **from inside `onLine`**, which is where an application usually stops
following. And there is no `StreamWait`: a blocking spelling that calls back
per line while the loop is frozen is a contradiction. The framing is yours —
`data:` is one `startsWith` — and a body that is not valid UTF-8 ends the
flight through `onError` rather than arriving as mojibake, the same bargain
`Bytes.ToText()` makes. libsoup is optional at build time; without it `Http`
says which package is missing. `examples/http` (a console tool),
`examples/jokes` (a window on JokeAPI), `examples/session` (auth plus cookies
against httpbingo) and `examples/serve` (a static file server) are the whole
of it running.

## Http Server

Serving over the same transport, on the loop the application already runs.

```js
const srv = Http.Server({ Port: 0 });   // 0 is ephemeral: read it back
srv.Request = (req) => {
    if (req.Path === "/hi") req.Answer(200, "hola");
    else req.Answer(404, "nope");
};
srv.Start();
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `Server([opts])` | `Port` (`8080` unless told, `0` ephemeral), `Host` (`"local"` loopback only, `"any"` is an explicit word), `ServerName` (the `Server:` header, `""` for soup's own), `Tls`, `Allow`, `Auth`. The options are an object — a bare port is refused |
| `Tls` | `{ Cert, Key }` files, or nothing: `https` when set, `null` when not. **Missing files fail at `Start`, naming them** |
| `Allow` | a list of **exact** IPs, or nothing (open). A refused remote gets `403` before the handler runs. Exact means exact: on a dual-stack `"any"` server, `::1` is not `127.0.0.1` |
| `Auth` | `{ Realm, Users }`: Basic over the whole server, `401` with the realm until the right password. Nothing set is open, and it reads back `null`. Like `Allow`, it takes effect at once |
| `req.Multipart()` | the upload parsed: a `Multipart` to read with `Part(index)` (or re-post). Refused on a plain body |
| `Request` | assign `(req) => …`. **Required before `Start`**, and replaceable while running — even from inside the handler: the running one finishes its request and the next goes to the new one |
| `Start()` | listens; throws naming the reason (a busy port says which one). A second `Start` is refused |
| `Stop()` | `true` while something was listening, `false` after — like signalling a reaped child. **From inside a handler it waits for the handler**: `Answer` fills the message in and soup sends it when the handler returns, so `req.Answer(200, "bye"); srv.Stop();` answers first and disconnects after. `Running` stays true until the deferred disconnect runs |
| `Running`, `Port`, `Url` | `Port` is declared until `Start`, actual after; `Url` is `""` until then, and empty again after `Stop` |
| `Answer(status, [body], [opts])` | `body` follows the client's rules — an object serialises as canonical JSON — and `opts` carries `Headers` and `ContentType`. **The second argument is always the body and the third always the options** |
| `req.Method`, `req.Path`, `req.Query`, `req.Headers`, `req.Body`, `req.Remote` | `Headers` lower-cased and `Body` always `Bytes`, like the client's answers; `Query` repeats keep one; `Remote` is the IP |
| second `Answer`, late `Answer` | refused: the request was already answered / already ended. A handler that returns without answering gets a `500` |

A listening server counts like a watch: a console project that returned from
`main` with one running stays for its requests. Dropping it without `Stop`
disconnects. **The handler answers before it returns**: there is no deferred
answer, so a route that must ask a database or another server first has nowhere
to wait — a `Wait` inside the handler freezes the loop the server answers on,
and returning to answer later gets the `500`. `examples/serve` is a static file
server in ten lines of handler; it carries no `".."` refusal because soup
normalizes dot-segments before the handler runs.

## AudioPlayer

Sound with no window: an alarm cue, a stream listened to, the audio half of
anything [`Video`](controls.md#video) shows. One playbin3 per player, with the
video branch switched off and never decoded — several may play at once.

```js
const cue = new AudioPlayer();
cue.Uri = "done.ogg";
cue.OnEnded = () => print("ding");
cue.OnError = (msg) => print(`no cue: ${msg}`);
cue.Play();
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `new AudioPlayer()` | a player of its own. Takes no arguments; everything below is assigned |
| `Uri` | what to play: a URI (`file://`, `http(s)://`, `rtsp://`) **or a plain local path**, which is turned into one. One property for both, so there is nothing to disagree. Setting it stops whatever was playing |
| `User` | RTSP digest identity, applied to the source the playbin builds. `""` for none |
| `Password` | the secret beside it. **Write-only**: it reads back `""` and is never serialised, so no `.form` carries it in clear text |
| `Latency` | ms the RTSP jitterbuffer may hold. Default `2000`, the source's own. Read when the source is built, so a change lands on the next `Play` from a stopped player |
| `Volume` | `0`…`1`. Default `1` |
| `Muted` | silence without touching `Volume`, so unmuting comes back to where it was |
| `Loop` | reseek instead of ending. A live stream cannot seek, so it ends anyway |
| `Buffering` (ro) | how full the buffer is, `0`…`100`. `100` is nothing to wait for — a local file never says otherwise — and less is a stream refilling, which **holds the sound while `Playing` stays true**. It is [`ProgressBar.Value`](../reference/widgets/ProgressBar.md)'s range, since that is where a form puts it |
| `Position` (ro) | seconds in, `0` when unknown — which includes playing live |
| `Duration` (ro) | seconds long, `-1` while unknown — which is always, on a live stream |
| `Playing` (ro) | whether it is going — what `Play` asked for, until `Pause`, `Stop`, the end or an error. **Not a sample of the pipeline**, which reads as stopped mid-loop and mid-rebuffer |
| `Seekable` (ro) | whether `Seek` has anything to work on. Answered once the stream is known, not when playing starts |
| `OnEnded` | assign `() => …`, called when it plays to the end; `null` takes it off. **Anything else is refused where it is assigned**, rather than silently never called |
| `OnError` | assign `(message, kind) => …`; the same rule. `kind` is `NotFound`, `NotAuthorized`, `Unreachable`, `Decode` or `Error`, as a `Video`'s is |
| `Play()` | plays, and replays from the top after it ended. **Refused with no `Uri`** |
| `Pause()` | holds the position |
| `Stop()` | parks it: back to no state, the position forgotten |
| `Seek(seconds)` | jumps there. **Refused on a stream that cannot seek**, naming it |

**A cue nobody keeps is still heard.** A playing player holds itself up, so
the shape a confirmation sound actually has works:

```js
function ding() {                        // nothing keeps the player
    const a = new AudioPlayer();
    a.Uri = "done.ogg";
    a.Play();
}
```

It is released at the end, at an error, or at `Pause`/`Stop` — so a paused
player is a deliberate hold that keeps nothing alive, and a console project
that returned from `main` with one playing stays for its end or its error
(with `Loop`, that is until something stops it). As with `Video`, `Play`
replays from the top after the end, setting `Uri` stops whatever was playing,
a stream that runs its buffer dry is held until it refills (`Buffering` says
how far along that is), and GStreamer is optional at build time — without it the constructor says which package is
missing.

## Others

`print(...)` — a line to stdout, arguments joined with a space.
`BTA_VERSION` — the runtime's version string.

There is no `Promise`, no `window`, no `document`, no `fetch`, no `require`.
`Http` above is the one that speaks to a network; anything else still goes through
a child process (`Exec(["curl", …])`), which is a choice you should say out loud
to whoever asked.
